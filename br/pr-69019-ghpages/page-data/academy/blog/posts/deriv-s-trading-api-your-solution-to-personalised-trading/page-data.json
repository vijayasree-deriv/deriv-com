Find out what API is, how it works, and how you can use it.","test_data":false,"published_date":"2022-04-21","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use an API on a daily basis without even realising it. For example, every time you click the 'Continue with Facebook' button to log in to an app, API gets involved. A weather app on your phone works with the help of API as well. And even online shops work via API. So how does it work?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we'll explain what an API is, how it works, and how you can use </span><a href=\"https://api.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv API</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your benefit.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an API</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API stands for application programming interface. It may sound a little complicated for non-technical people, but it simply refers to a way of communication designed specifically for computers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example of an API in action would be a flight aggregator like Skyscanner &ndash; a website that displays flights and airlines available on dates you select. This website communicates with numerous airline websites and retrieves data from them, such as flight times and prices, using an API.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, an API is mostly used by trading apps and platforms to fetch data like live quotes and trading conditions from the brokers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv API does exactly the same &ndash; provides access to Deriv's trading conditions and assets available for trading to third-party software, like your trading app or platform.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How an API works</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to human communication, programming communication requires an exchange of information between two sides &mdash; a requestor and a respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our earlier example, the aggregator website acts as a requester, asking for flight data, while the airlines' websites act as the respondents that provide the requested information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API users commonly refer to the requesting side as a client and the responding side as a server. An API is no more than software that enables a client and a server to communicate with each other by sending requests and responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each request and response is called an API call and can be written in different programming languages, depending on the requirements of the server &ndash; Java or Python.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you can do with Deriv API</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Deriv API, you have the freedom to personalise your trading experience. Just build your own trading app or platform, add the features you like, and connect it to the Deriv server via our API. The API will transmit data from our server to your app, enabling you to trade just the way you want.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, besides adding a unique personal touch to your trading journey, you can take your API activities even further and monetise them.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you can earn with Deriv API</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the 3 opportunities to earn with Deriv API:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build your app, sign up as a </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/partners/affiliate-ib/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv affiliate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and get commissions on trades completed via your app and the affiliate plan you select.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://api.deriv.com/docs/app-registration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register your trading app or platform with Deriv</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, add a markup to the contract prices, and profit from every purchased contract.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up as a </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/partners/payment-agent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payment agent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, build your custom website to process payments for Deriv&rsquo;s clients, and earn commission on every transaction completed via your website.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9cb0d64e-fe03-4bc4-8990-bb8a600c0498\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9cb0d64e-fe03-4bc4-8990-bb8a600c0498\" alt=\"How to Earn with Deriv API\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undoubtedly, creating an app or a website requires a set of skills that not everyone may have, such as knowing programming languages and having coding experience. But if you don't have those skills, you can hire a developer to create an app or platform for you &ndash; all you'll need to do is promote it once it's done and build your network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need help with software development, the </span><a href=\"https://binary.vanillacommunity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv developers&rsquo; community</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be a great place to find the right person.
