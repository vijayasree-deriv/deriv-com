Although yields continued to fall for the next two days, the yield curve started to flatten, with the 2-year yield rising above 0.52%, strengthening the US dollar and limiting the upside potential for gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this, on Thursday, 28 October 2021, the GDP was announced by the BEA and was not up to par with the forecast (2.0% vs 2.7%), leading to a fall in the US dollar. However, this was not for long as the economic data on initial jobless claims was favourable (281K vs 290K), retreating gold at around $1,800.17 high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On 29 October 2021, gold slipped by around -$18.70 at $1,783.02 due to the rise in the US yields.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s next?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ISM manufacturing PMI is scheduled for next week, followed by the FOMC meeting later in the week. If the policymakers adopt a hawkish approach, the US dollar will outperform, and gold could turn bearish in the near term. On the other hand, if the policymakers adopt a dovish approach, downplaying the inflation concerns and focusing on the fall in GDP (Q3) would create selling pressure on the dollar and allow gold to go up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initial jobless claims and Non-farm Payrolls are also scheduled for the week wherein a strong figure could support the US dollar and vice versa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade Gold options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>EUR/USD</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/747f9b4f-80a7-43d6-bafe-47e05ecdf29b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/747f9b4f-80a7-43d6-bafe-47e05ecdf29b\" alt=\"EUR/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"2818\" height=\"1556\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><br /></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened last week?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept its monetary policy unchanged. Despite inflationary concerns, the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, insisted that inflation is transitory and shall decrease next year. The GDP announcement (2.0% actual vs 2.7% forecast) cooled down the expectations for aggressive tapering in the US. The reason for the downfall was mainly attributed to slow consumer spending and supply chain concerns.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s next?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US will be publishing the ISM manufacturing PMI on Monday, 1 November, 2021, with the forecast at 60.4 (the previous at 61.1). On Wednesday, 3 November, 2021, the country will publish the ADP Non-farm employment change, with the forecast being at 400k (the previous being at 568K), followed by the monetary policy decision undertaken by the US Federal Reserve. Also, the country will publish the Non-farm Payroll report with the forecast of around 397k new jobs (the previous being 194k).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side, the EU calendar would focus on Retail sales (for September) and ECB&rsquo;s President Lagarde speech.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade EUR/USD options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>GBP/USD</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4076765-c23b-4e02-b58e-70a228f84dd9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4076765-c23b-4e02-b58e-70a228f84dd9\" alt=\"GBP/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"2814\" height=\"1550\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><br /></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened last week?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last week, the dollar struggled due to the GDP data (2.0% actual vs 2.7% forecast), and the yield curve that continued to fall started to flatten by the end of the week, allowing GBP/USD to improve despite the current Brexit issues.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s next?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ISM Purchasing Manager Index is scheduled this week for the USD (60.4 Forecast vs 61.1 Previous). As the forecast is well above 60, it could reflect strong economic growth, the Non-farm Payroll report with the forecast of around 397k new jobs (previous being 194k). As mentioned earlier, a monetary policy decision will be undertaken by the Federal Reserve this week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For GBP, the calendar would be focusing more on the upcoming inflation report and the interest rate decision by the Bank of England. However, the question is, will the Bank of England increase the rates?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade GBP/USD options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading on commodities and forex on DTrader are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>","author":{"id":"0d7772f6-5338-488f-a8aa-adfb6c5074b9","name":"The Deriv team","image":{"id":"9826d676-357b-4683-8f80-28a4ef931f91","description":"Deriv Logo","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}},"main_image":{"id":"e97a572a-82f8-4267-bb13-0ae991c59b80","description":"Market report on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}},"og_image":null,"tags":[{"id":"129","tags_id":{"id":"da1e8e57-d401-4d81-b0d5-e8429c2f565c","tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"footer_banners":{"id":"12","cta_url":"https://deriv.com/dmt5/","name":"DMT5","desktop_banner_image":{"id":"dcb9e47f-9713-42da-9bd5-341c3466c822","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}},"mobile_banner_image":{"id":"0de58210-f15b-4873-b57b-886df8c840c4","description":"CFD Trading on Deriv MT5","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}},"side_banners":{"id":"de87b411-ac63-4803-b521-e801b5b1fd82","cta_url":"https://deriv.com/landing/ebooks/forex/","name":"Forex ebook vertical","banner_image":{"id":"60904033-9233-4420-8a3b-b8857ff9416e","description":"Forex Trading Ebook on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/2e131/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).png","srcSet":"/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/0bdb4/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).png 71w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/c073b/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).png 141w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/2e131/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).png 282w","sizes":"(min-width: 282px) 282px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/cc8a3/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).webp 71w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/b3492/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).webp 141w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/fa80263a8808b887d2864b2fd6b8bd0b/f65dd/Forex%20trading%20ebook%20on%20Deriv%20(desktop).webp 282w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 282px) 282px, 100vw"}]},"width":282,"height":480}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"locale":"en","pathname":"/academy/blog/posts/the-weekly-market-report-01-11-2021-07-11-2021/","slug":"the-weekly-market-report-01-11-2021-07-11-2021"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1403902406","188943173","2998272888","3480019573","4141256230","764694655"]}
