This fall was a result of financial markets being gripped by panic as recession fears persisted and inflationary pressures rose, further intensified by Russia's energy crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second consecutive week, the British pound declined against the US dollar, bringing prices to their lowest since March 2020. Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend. The chart above shows that the pair was priced just above the 5 and 10 SMA's, ending its week at around $1.2035.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the USD/JPY pair continued to rise, it did not break through its 24-year high of &yen;137.00. The US June payrolls eased recession fears, causing the USD/JPY to rise. Furthermore, the inaction of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) towards its ultra-loose monetary policy and Shinzo Abe's assassination have hindered the yen's value and weakened the Japanese economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will be important for currencies since the US and the UK will release June inflation figures and UK GDP data.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment. However, it was down by 3.53% for the week. The chart shows the drastic drop and highlights that gold ended the week between a thin resistance and support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 2% on Friday, 8 July 2022, as the market remained concerned about whether the jobs sector is strong and the possibility of the Fed raising rates aggressively. However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general. Furthermore, worries over a potential recession pulled prices down for the week and led to oil prices touching their 12-week low mid-week.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, the price went above the $22,000 mark on Friday, 8 July 2022 and maintained its upward momentum since the start of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also increased by around 9% in the last 7 days. Meanwhile, Polygon surged upwards by 19%, Avalanche climbed by over 10%, and Solana increased by nearly 7% for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Dogecoin (DOGE) rose after Elon Musk's The Boring Company, a construction and infrastructure company, announced that it would accept DOGE as a payment currency. DOGE has surpassed Polkadot to become the tenth-largest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of around $9.37 billion. Over the last 7 days, the cryptocurrency has gained by approximately 7%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Stocks market</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,338.15</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">370.33</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.20%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,125.69</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">345.79</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.94%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,899.38</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">67.99</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.77%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All 3 major averages finished the week in green.

Furthermore, last week's gains lifted the S&amp;P 500 Index out of bear market territory, and it is now down by only 19.1% from its peak in January. Meanwhile, Friday's payrolls report from the Labor Department revealed that employers added 3,72,000 nonfarm jobs in June, exceeding consensus expectations of around 2,70,000. Although the jobs report was positive for the economy, many traders expect the Federal Reserve to fight inflation with rate hikes in the coming months aggressively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Twitter lost more than 5% on Friday, 8 July 2022, and ranked among the worst performers in the S&amp;P 500 due to reports that Elon Musk might withdraw his takeover offer.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The corporate earnings season will start next week, with JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup set to report their second-quarter earnings.
