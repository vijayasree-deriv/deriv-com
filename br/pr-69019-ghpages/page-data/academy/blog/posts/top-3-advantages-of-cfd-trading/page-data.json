If you've already heard about </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but are still unsure about whether to start, let's talk about its major benefits and the easiest strategy for beginners to start their CFD trading journey.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Wide selection of markets and assets</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main advantages of CFD trading is access to all the largest financial markets at once &ndash; forex, commodities, stocks &amp; indices, and cryptocurrencies. You can have a wide selection of assets in every market, which gives you the opportunity to diversify your portfolio. This is considered a good risk management strategy to prevent big losses.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Deriv, you have an additional option to trade synthetic indices, a market that is available round the clock, much like the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, all the markets and assets can be accessed within the same platform &ndash; Deriv MT5.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Opportunity to profit from both falling and rising markets</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In CFD trading, you predict the price movement of an underlying asset without buying it. Remember, you&rsquo;re trading on a contract for difference, not the actual asset. So it doesn't matter if the price rises or falls; as long as it moves according to your prediction, you may earn a profit. Unlike other trade types, a CFD trade can be opened not only with a buy order (going long) but a sell order (going short) as well, even if you don&rsquo;t have anything to sell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s say you believe the price of an asset will go down because the company failed to reach its targets for the quarter, which usually leads to a sell-off &ndash; a large number of its shares being sold at a low price. If you place a sell order on its stock CFD, and your prediction is correct, you earn a profit. To execute this kind of trades successfully, it&rsquo;s important to understand the general logic behind </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">going long and going short</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in CFD trading.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Cost-effective capital utilisation</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As CFDs are typically traded on margin, you can use it as an opportunity to build a cost-effective trading strategy. Since you only need to pay a small percentage of the trade value, your budget can be allocated into several trades at once. There is also a stop loss feature to protect you from losing too much of your capital if the trade goes against your prediction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, you don&rsquo;t have to pay an additional tax on asset ownership since you don't own the underlying asset when trading CFDs, which can be a big advantage. Most brokers also don't charge a commission for CFD trading, making it even more cost-effective.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can beginners benefit from the advantages of CFD trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional traders have quite a few CFD trading strategies. Some of them are very complex and require technical knowledge. But, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that beginners can&rsquo;t benefit from the advantages of this form of trading. Here is a relatively easy way to start: news trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most financial markets are affected by economic and political events in one way or another. As a result, big announcements are usually followed by big price fluctuations of the related assets. For example, the UK pound has experienced a big drop right after Brexit. And Bitcoin&rsquo;s price went skyrocketing when Tesla bought over a billion USD worth of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping an eye on the big headlines and learning how they affect the prices would be a good beginning of the CFD trading journey. Once you know how to connect the dots, you can start predicting the price movements and benefit from them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're not confident with news trading, you can opt for trading synthetic market. With Deriv&rsquo;s synthetics trading, you trade CFDs on indices that simulate real-world market movements but are not affected by world events. On this market, the price movements are randomly generated by a cryptographically secure algorithm and are regularly audited by a third party for fairness.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever market you choose to start, you can do so by creating a demo account to get your practice in before investing any money.
