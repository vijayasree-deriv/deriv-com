There are fears of recession in all 4 markets, with some assets experiencing their worst quarter for the year and others experiencing their worst first two quarters in over 50 years.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0d779b63-9c4b-474c-a288-d661a8c14270?width=1742&amp;height=857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0d779b63-9c4b-474c-a288-d661a8c14270?width=1742&amp;height=857\" alt=\"EUR/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a>Source: Bloomberg.

Despite holding above the $1.06 level in the first half of the week, the leading currency pair plunged as low as $1.0366 &ndash; its lowest level since June. Although US dollar bulls rallied throughout the week, recession fears pushed it back. Based on the chart above, the pair ended the week at around $1.0414, establishing a bearish tone with lower lows and lower highs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders were concerned that aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank would tip the global economy into recession. There was a ray of hope, however, that emerged from China lifting its lockdown, alleviating inflation and growth concerns and temporarily favouring US dollar bears.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the recent bearish consolidation re-energised GBP sellers, who smashed GBP/USD below $1.20 for the first time in 2 weeks. Last week, the pair lost around 200 pips, effectively ending the previous week's recovery. GBP was under pressure due to Brexit fears and recession fears.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, the markets are awaiting the minutes of the June Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the US Nonfarm Payrolls for a new direction.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3a430536-b772-48ea-abd6-0fcfb49a5e94?width=1733&amp;height=851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3a430536-b772-48ea-abd6-0fcfb49a5e94?width=1733&amp;height=851\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

In the last week, spot gold prices dropped by 1.04%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) statistics released on Friday, 1 July 2022, fueled fears of a recession and sent gold prices to their lowest level in five weeks &ndash; $1,783.50. In June, the US ISM Manufacturing PMI dropped to 53.0 from 54.9 and 56.1 in May, marking the lowest reading in 2 years.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Powell's semi-annual congressional testimony on Wednesday, 29 June 2022, didn't stimulate the gold market but came off as sufficiently hawkish to drive gold prices down for the week. Furthermore, due to hawkish monetary policies from top central banks, gold, which doesn't pay interest, suffered its worst quarter in more than a year.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, gold maintained its bearish tone. However, it bounced back on the last day of the week and held its position above the 5 and 10 SMA at $1,806 and $1,801, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, oil prices declined for the week as concerns about a worldwide recession weighed on the market at a time when supply remains constrained due to OPEC&nbsp; (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) production declines, unrest in Libya, and sanctions against Russia.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bb0c880c-4cbb-4426-9c06-191b7a0e0f9b?width=1733&amp;height=852\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bb0c880c-4cbb-4426-9c06-191b7a0e0f9b?width=1733&amp;height=852\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin, the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency, fell below $20,000 while almost all altcoins, starting from Ethereum, bled.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin entered the week with a solid $21,073.55 and closed below $20,000. This was the third-worst monthly closing in history with high uncertainty in the global economy and the crypto market.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin hit its lowest on Friday, 1 July 2022, when the price reached $18,728. However, since then, it managed to gain traction and maintain a sideways position for the week at around $19,421.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum, on the other hand, failed in its attempt to recover. It instead followed a stable downward trend with an opening price of $1,203.85, finishing the week at $1,072.16 while struggling to stay in the $1,100 price zone.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, traders' massive sell-off and crypto company Celsius' pausing of withdrawal services appear to have triggered the crypto crash.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US stock markets</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial Avg (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,097.26</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-341.00</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.08%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,585.68</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-422.56</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.52%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,825.33</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-74.78</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.92%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change and net change (%) are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US stock markets finished their worst first half in over 50 years as the economy heads into the second half of 2022.
