Last week, gold hit the $1,800 mark and dropped back to $1,764. In the absence of major fundamental data, gold prices might be confined to the same range. It might also focus on the development of the US treasury yield and the US dollar index. The first resistance levels appear to be $1,780 - $1,786 followed by 50% retracement levels near $1,800, while $1,750 &ndash; the previous week's low &ndash; might provide some support, followed by the major downside channel support near $1,720.</p>\n<p>Trade Gold options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Financial account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eurusd\">EUR/USD</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/7d811632-17ba-4396-9222-6ea96aead59a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/7d811632-17ba-4396-9222-6ea96aead59a\" alt=\"EUR/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1222\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The EUR/USD pair has been moving sideways, too, for the past week. It has been hovering around its 52-week low for more than three weeks but it failed to break out on either side. Support levels near 1.1525 are proving to be key, as the pair has taken support at this level multiple times and bounced back. On a daily basis, the RSI is showing a divergence, which indicates a bullish trend in the short-to-medium term. Technically speaking, 1.15 could provide major support, while on the higher side, once EUR/USD sustains above 1.1620, it might attempt to reach the 1.17 levels.</p>\n<p>Trade EUR/USD options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>DTrader</strong></a>&nbsp;and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a>&nbsp;Financial and Financial STP accounts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nasdaq-%E2%80%94-tech-100\">NASDAQ &mdash; Tech 100</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3e7d3143-8774-49f1-abc9-aee300a084d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3e7d3143-8774-49f1-abc9-aee300a084d5\" alt=\"Nasdaq chart on Deriv\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1230\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The US Tech Index, Nasdaq managed to pull back in the last week and closed above its resistance level of $15,000. It was the first major bullish week since the past month. The index is likely to depend on the upcoming quarterly results from some tech giant companies like Netflix and others over the next couple of weeks. In the coming week, $14,800 will provide support. However, on the upside, if it crosses the 61.8% retracement level of $15,192, it might reach the 78.6% retracement level of $15,400.</p>\n<p>Trade US Tech Index options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a>&nbsp;Financial accounts.<br /><br /></p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>Options trading on stock indices, commodities, and forex on DTrader are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</em></p>","author":{"id":"0d7772f6-5338-488f-a8aa-adfb6c5074b9","name":"The Deriv team","image":{"id":"9826d676-357b-4683-8f80-28a4ef931f91","description":"Deriv Logo","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/de3a1/deriv%20profile%20pic.png","srcSet":"/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/f2a56/deriv%20profile%20pic.png 38w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/7458e/deriv%20profile%20pic.png 75w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/de3a1/deriv%20profile%20pic.png 150w","sizes":"(min-width: 150px) 150px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/0852d/deriv%20profile%20pic.webp 38w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/18188/deriv%20profile%20pic.webp 75w,\n/deriv-com/br/pr-69019-ghpages/static/2efee03fa50ea098c4f945ea8267e57d/c65bc/deriv%20profile%20pic.webp 150w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 150px) 150px, 100vw"}]},"width":150,"height":150}}}}},"main_image":{"id":"7a7bae2b-a9ec-4372-b326-89712d3c9431","description":"Market report on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}},"og_image":null,"tags":[{"id":"124","tags_id":{"id":"da1e8e57-d401-4d81-b0d5-e8429c2f565c","tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"footer_banners":{"id":"8","cta_url":"https://deriv.com/landing/ebooks/forex/","name":"Forex ebook","desktop_banner_image":{"id":"01b3e6ce-a9af-48d9-a707-cb07b604036a","description":"Forex Trading Ebook on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}},"mobile_banner_image":{"id":"010b47e5-4a0f-47b2-ac58-3c5922b2a360","description":"Forex Trading Ebook on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}},"side_banners":{"id":"398a9eab-4d62-4aab-af73-cb7d8fbb64f7","cta_url":"https://deriv.com/dmt5/","name":"DMT5 vertical","banner_image":{"id":"c2f323b4-a180-4524-8b4d-fb06b411e00d","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":null}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"locale":"en","pathname":"/academy/blog/posts/the-weekly-market-report-18-10-2021-24-10-2021/","slug":"the-weekly-market-report-18-10-2021-24-10-2021"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1403902406","188943173","2998272888","3480019573","4141256230","764694655"]}
