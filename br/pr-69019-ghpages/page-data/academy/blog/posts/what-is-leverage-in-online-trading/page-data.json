However, not everyone understands what it means. So in this blog, we'll talk about what leverage is, how it works, and what markets you can trade with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is leverage</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage is a crucial aspect of <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFD trading</a>. It refers to using borrowed funds to increase your trading position beyond what your cash balance allows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many traders take advantage of leverage to improve their strategies and maximise their potential gains. But, there's a catch to leverage: it can also result in larger losses than expected if it's not used strategically. That's why before applying it to your trades, make sure you've carefully analysed the markets and are sufficiently confident it will benefit you.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How it works</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, leverage lets you open larger positions for a fraction of the trade&rsquo;s value. For example, if you want to open a CFD of asset X that costs 1,000 USD, even if you only have 10 USD, you can do so with leverage of 1:100.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The higher the leverage, the lower the capital you need to open a trade. This in turn boosts the purchasing power of your capital allowing you to take advantage of small price changes and to expand your market exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margin refers to the deposit required to open a leveraged position, taking into account spreads, leveraging, and currency conversions. You use a <a href=\"https://deriv.com/trader-tools/margin-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">margin calculator</a> t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o determine how much margin you need to increase the market value of your position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if asset X has a price of 100 USD and the leverage is 1:100, then the required margin to open 1 CFD of X will only be 1 USD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;d like to open a position of 100 CFDs (or 100 lots) of X with a buy order (you expect that the prices of asset X will increase), here are the possible outcomes of the trade opened with leverage:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the price of X increases to 105 USD, you make a profit of 5 USD per CFD.<br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you bought 100 CFDs, this gives you a total profit of 500 USD </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(100 CFDs âœ• 5 USD = 500 USD).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the price of X decreases to 95 USD, your total loss is 500 USD.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on these outcomes, leverage can increase profits, but it can also increase losses.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to manage risk in leveraged trading</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraged trading involves high risks, so it&rsquo;s smart to use standard risk management features on trading platforms such as stop loss and take profit. Stop loss and take profit orders will help limit the potential loss you may incur or secure the profit you make.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you place a stop loss order, you specify the exact price at which your position will automatically close at a loss. It lets you specify how much you want to risk, allowing you to limit your losses before they grow larger than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas when you place a take profit order, you specify the exact price at which your position will automatically close. This allows you to secure your target profit before the market moves against your favour.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Markets to trade with leverage on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The markets you can trade with leverage on Deriv are forex, stocks and stock indices, cryptocurrency, commodities, and synthetic indices.

If you&rsquo;re a beginner, a smart way to work your way around it is by starting small no matter how tempting the leverage ratio is. It's never a good idea to head straight for large amounts, as doing so may completely impact your trades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to practice trading with leverage?
