Check out the benefits of forex trading and see why you should start trading the biggest financial market in the world too.","test_data":false,"published_date":"2022-02-10","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is not only the biggest financial market in the world, it is also one of the most accessible markets to trade on. This marketplace is made up of buyers and sellers from all over the world participating in </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forex live trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and offers opportunities suitable for both beginner and experienced traders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about whether to add forex to your trading portfolio, read on to find out why you should.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade 24/5&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is open round the clock on weekdays, giving you even more opportunities to trade international currency pairs and take advantage of their price movements. Thanks to the business hours of forex exchanges across international time zones, at least one region is operating at any point during the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four major exchanges around the world that start and end the trading day are Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York &mdash; with these exchanges, forex trading starts at 9:00 pm (GMT) on Sunday and ends at 9:00 pm (GMT) on Friday.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gain exposure to global economic markets&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade forex, you&rsquo;re able to gain international exposure to different global markets depending on the currency pair or basket you trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex currency pairs are categorised into major, minor, and exotic pairs, and are made up of currencies from all over the world. These three categories have different liquidity levels that represent how actively traded the currency pairs are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also trade currency basket indices. These indices measure the value of one currency against a basket of five other equally weighted global currencies, increasing your exposure to even more global markets at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade a highly liquid market</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought and sold. When a market is highly liquid, it basically means that there are lots of buyers and sellers trading at any point, leading to a higher trading volume and lower transaction costs as traders seek to complete transactions easily and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is one of the most liquid in the world, with over 6 trillion USD traded daily. With the large number of active trades happening every day and low costs, it becomes easier for traders to enter the forex market and start trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profit from both rising and falling prices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade forex via options, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs (contract for differences)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and multipliers, which all allow you to potentially profit from rising as well as falling prices. With these trade types, you&rsquo;ll be predicting the price movements of currency pairs or baskets, and if the price moves according to your prediction, you&rsquo;ll earn a profit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trades are timed, so you&rsquo;ll be predicting market movements within a specific time period. On the other hand, CFDs trades can stay open for as long as you want to take advantage of market movements (as long as you have sufficient funds in your account to cover potential losses in case the market moves against you). With multipliers, you&rsquo;ll get to multiply your potential profits without losing more than your stake.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start trading with low capital requirement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the highly liquid nature of the forex market and low transaction costs, you can open a forex trade even with relatively low capital. On Deriv, all you need is a 5 USD deposit into your account, and you can start trading forex on any of Deriv&rsquo;s platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the most of high leverage</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade major, minor, and exotic currencies with high leverage. Trading with leverage gives you more market exposure by allowing you to trade more than your capital allows. This means that you get to open a trade that&rsquo;s worth more than your stake. For example, with a leverage of 1:10 and a stake amount of 100 USD, you&rsquo;ll get to open a trade that&rsquo;s actually worth 1,000 USD.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profit or loss you make at the end of your trade is based on the trade&rsquo;s full value, so trading with leverage allows you to maximise your capital and increase your potential profits. However, do note that this also means that potential losses are also increased.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of tight spreads</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices, and represents the cost to open a CFD trade. These are determined by the broker and are calculated in pips, which are small price movements of an asset.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv offers one of the tightest competitive spreads in the industry, with spreads as low as 0.5 pips. In a highly liquid market like forex where there&rsquo;s a high trading volume and transactions are completed quickly, the tighter the spread, the faster you are likely to gain back your capital and take greater advantage from the price changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- - -</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about options trading and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Deriv before you get started.
