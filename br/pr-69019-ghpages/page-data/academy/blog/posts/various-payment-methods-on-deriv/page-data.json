For instance, we constantly look into payment methods that are popular among our clients in various locations and add them to our portfolio. So, no matter where you are, you will always have several options.</p>\n<h2>Types of payment methods on Deriv</h2>\n<h3>Online banking</h3>\n<p>Online banking, or bank wire, is one of the oldest forms of digital transaction methods, widely used globally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This method allows you to access your bank account online and conduct transactions. All you need is a device that can be connected to the Internet.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are some of the bank wires we support:</span></p>\n<h3><a title=\"The various online banking methods available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2f210180-d909-40cf-a349-e732f1bef75f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2f210180-d909-40cf-a349-e732f1bef75f\" alt=\"The various online banking methods available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></h3>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Credit/Debit card</strong><br /></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit and debit cards are one of the most popular payment methods that require you to have an active card with a bank. Whether you can use credit, debit or both types of cards is usually determined by your location and the card provider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, we accept both credit and debit cards for deposits and withdrawals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a full list of accepted cards:<br /></span></p>\n<p><a title=\"The different credit and debit cards available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bc60390e-787b-4a47-b6a8-f29f6bb3f3e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bc60390e-787b-4a47-b6a8-f29f6bb3f3e5\" alt=\"The different credit and debit cards available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that as the cardholder, you should be aware of the terms and conditions set by your bank.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>E-wallets</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-wallets represent a closed ecosystem, where funds circulate only between users and integrated merchants. This makes transactions much quicker, offering an overall smoother experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most e-wallets are used for international transactions as they have a global or at least continental reach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like credit and debit cards, each e-wallet has its unique authentication process. Among the most popular e-wallets are Skrill, Neteller, and PerfectMoney.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is the complete list of e-wallets available on Deriv:<br /></span></p>\n<p><a title=\"The list of e-wallets available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3a46d9ea-a6be-4ed3-a348-942676bab61a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2caf4ffb-9894-40a9-9445-36a18bcc4c08\" alt=\"The list of e-wallets available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<p>Besides fiat money, we also offer popular cryptocurrencies as payment methods on our platforms &ndash; Bitcoin (BTC), LiteCoin (LTC), Ether (ETH), USDT (Tether Omni Layer and Tether Erc-20), and USD Coin (USDC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"The different types of cryptocurrency methods available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/edd3f31f-8179-40c7-ae24-fc4a6510763e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/edd3f31f-8179-40c7-ae24-fc4a6510763e\" alt=\"The different types of cryptocurrency methods available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can transfer any of these digital coins from your cryptocurrency wallets directly to your Deriv account.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Fiat onramp</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don&rsquo;t own any cryptocurrency but would like to begin trading with it, we have a payment solution for you too. Our fiat onramp services allow you to purchase cryptocurrencies with physical money, also known as fiat money, and receive them directly into your Deriv trading account.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the fiat onramp methods available on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p><a title=\"The different types of fiat onramp methods available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fcc78560-b1d3-48fd-aa27-0fd6b893da7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fcc78560-b1d3-48fd-aa27-0fd6b893da7d\" alt=\"The different types of fiat onramp methods available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></span></a></p>\n<h3>Additional payment methods (APMs)&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Additional payment methods, or APMs, are payment methods that do not require cards of any kind. These payment methods are perfect for clients who prefer the traditional modes as APMs include prevalent local payment methods such as vouchers and cash settlements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some popular APMs on Deriv are the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Vouchers and disbursements&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>These are prepaid payment methods widespread in African countries. With these, you can choose how much money to send merchants and the duration these vouchers and disbursements are to be active.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Cash settlements</h4>\n<p>This is a popular payment method in Latin American countries, in the form of an invoice issued by a bank that allows you to pay the exact amount you owe. As long as the settlement is paid within the due date on the invoice, you can pay it anywhere it is accepted.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Payment Agents</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment agents are independent exchangers on Deriv, ranging from currency exchangers, affiliates and community managers. These agents interact with traders who want to make deposits and withdrawals through local bank wires and e-payment methods.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment agents can determine their commission per transaction (subject to our established thresholds), choose which countries to service, and how to promote their services.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Deriv P2P</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv P2P is our peer-to-peer deposit and withdrawal service that lets you move funds in and out of your Deriv account. With this app, you can connect with your fellow traders, exchange USD in your local currency, and get your deposits and withdrawals done within minutes.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv P2P is also very convenient, as you can exchange funds anytime, and you get to choose your exchange rates. The best part? It is available as web and mobile apps, so you can easily make your transactions on any of your devices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have learned about the various payment methods on our platforms, head to the Cashier, choose your preferred payment method, and make a deposit to start trading
