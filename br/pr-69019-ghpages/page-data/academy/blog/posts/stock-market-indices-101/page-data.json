Some indices are made of top-ranked companies in the market, while others may consist of handpicked companies from a particular stock market category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By compiling stock information of companies, stock indices allow you to get insights into the overall trend of price movements, market sentiment and general financial health of a market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s take a glimpse at how they work.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are stock market indices calculated?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stock index price indicates the average price of stocks in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various considerations when selecting which stocks will be included in a particular stock index. This could include the size of the company, its market capitalisation, or even its industry.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the companies are selected, the next step is to determine how much weight each of them will have in the index, as the weight of each stock may influence the index value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most popular ways indices are weighted:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this index type, stocks with a larger market capitalisation carry more weight. A company's market capitalisation can be calculated by multiplying its current stock price by the number of outstanding stocks. For instance, if a company has 1 million stocks selling at USD30, this company&rsquo;s stocks would have a market capitalisation of USD30 million. This company would have much more weight compared to a company with a market cap of USD1 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, the price of the index will change drastically as the price of the stock with a higher market cap changes. On the other hand, if a company with a low market cap experiences any change, it would have minimal effect on the stock index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most common index weighting, and most major stock indices use it to calculate their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An equal-weighted index is where stocks are weighed against each other equally, regardless of their price, market capitalisation, or any other factor. This means that every company&rsquo;s performance affects the index equally. Thus, to find the index's price made of 100 stocks, you&rsquo;d need to add up all their prices and divide the sum by 100. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weight of each company in a price-weighted index is determined by its current stock price. Regardless of their size, companies with more expensive stocks would have a heavier weight in the index than those with a lower price. For instance, if the stock index consists of four stocks worth USD10, USD20, USD30 and USD40, the stocks would make up 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total index, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s important to note that each index can have multiple variations. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index, tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US, is usually market-capitalisation-weighted, but there is also an equal-weighted version of it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do stock market indices help traders? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock indices mainly function as economic indicators or market barometers that measure financial health. The average value of stocks in a specific country&rsquo;s stock market shows how well its economy is doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By observing these indices, you get a sense of how the overall market is doing without monitoring individual stocks, and you can evaluate the performance of the market by comparing the current price of an index to its previous price. This allows traders to analyse market trends and understand market sentiment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, traders can also opt to trade on these indices. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular stock market indices on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade on popular stock indices with <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/cfd-trading-vs-options-trading-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a> by predicting the indices&rsquo; market movement and without buying the underlying stocks.
