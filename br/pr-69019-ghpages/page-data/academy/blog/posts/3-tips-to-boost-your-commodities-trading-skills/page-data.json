The risk-return ratio from this volatility makes it more attractive to traders than other financial markets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 3 commodity trading tips to help you navigate the risks of trading in this market.</span></p>\n<h2>1. Understand the factors that affect commodity prices</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commodities are cyclical, meaning their prices move in repeating patterns or recur at regular intervals. And with supply and demand as the main price drivers, they are considered much more volatile compared to forex and stocks for example. Additionally, they are highly affected by economic, political, and natural disasters.</span></p>\n<h3>Economic</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A country's economic status can affect commodity prices as it determines the purchasing strength of its population. During weak economic times, commodities are less in demand, resulting in lower prices, while a boom in the economy can increase demand, resulting in higher prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When disruptions in supply occur in countries that are major producers of a particular commodity, the price change of that commodity is higher.</span></p>\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Political uncertainty and geopolitical events in certain regions, such as social unrest like riots and protests and closures of key transport routes, can severely affect a commodity&rsquo;s supply cycle. These events usually lead to production and transportation challenges, causing a shortage of supply, resulting in more volatility.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of such events include the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which led to higher tariffs, and the tensions in the Middle East, which resulted in disruptions in oil supply and higher prices.</span></p>\n<h3>Natural disasters</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natural disasters and extreme weather fluctuations can negatively affect natural resource production and transportation. Typhoons, for example, can destroy crops, affecting the supply chain, causing lower supply, and market price hikes later on.</span></p>\n<h2>2. Do an in-depth market analysis</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As commodity markets are volatile in nature, both beginners and seasoned traders must monitor their price movements closely before making a trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of analysis that traders use to check how a commodity market performs &mdash; fundamental and technical analysis. Here&rsquo;s a brief explanation of what these are:</span></p>\n<h3>Fundamental analysis</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis evaluates the intrinsic or &lsquo;true&rsquo; value of an asset and determines the factors that may affect it in the future. This analysis takes into consideration external events and influences along with financial records and market trends. Traders and investors use fundamental analysis to gather information based on financial data to make rational decisions before opening positions as well as to limit personal biases.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical analysis</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technical analysis</a> uses historical price charts and market statistics to examine and predict price movements in financial markets. The idea is that by investigating previous market patterns, traders can more accurately forecast future prices. Traders use technical analysis to develop or improve their trading strategies and determine the best time to enter and exit a market.</span></p>\n<h2>3. Befriend the market trends</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market trends, whether short-term or long-term, can provide insight into potential market movements. Generally, a trend represents how the price of an asset or the commodity market is moving. An uptrend occurs when prices are rising, and a downtrend occurs when prices are declining.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In commodity trading, traders take advantage of trends to better strategise their trades as they present higher chances of possible gains since prices tend to move in the same direction. This allows them to shift the odds in their favour and maximise their potential profits.</span></p>\n<h2>How to trade commodities on Deriv</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can speculate on the price movements of commodities with CFDs or options without actually buying or owning the underlying asset.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/552f99ce-f702-4455-b8cd-78f1a4f8dc80\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/552f99ce-f702-4455-b8cd-78f1a4f8dc80\" alt=\"Cfd trading on Deriv\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a>,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;you predict whether the price of an asset, gold, for example, will rise or fall.</span></p>\n<h3>Go long</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think the price of gold will go up against the US dollar (USD), you can buy a CFD and get a profit from that rise if the market moves according to your prediction.</span></p>\n<h3>Go short</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think the price of gold will go down, you can sell a CFD and profit from that fall if the market moves according to your prediction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An advantage of trading commodities with CFDs is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you can keep your position open until you decide to close it.
