Some indices are made of top-ranked companies in the market, while others may consist of handpicked companies from a particular stock market category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By compiling stock information of companies, stock indices allow you to get insights into the overall trend of price movements, market sentiment and general financial health of a market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s take a glimpse at how they work.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are stock market indices calculated?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stock index price indicates the average price of stocks in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various considerations when selecting which stocks will be included in a particular stock index. This could include the size of the company, its market capitalisation, or even its industry.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the companies are selected, the next step is to determine how much weight each of them will have in the index, as the weight of each stock may influence the index value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most popular ways indices are weighted:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this index type, stocks with a larger market capitalisation carry more weight. A company's market capitalisation can be calculated by multiplying its current stock price by the number of outstanding stocks. For instance, if a company has 1 million stocks selling at USD30, this company&rsquo;s stocks would have a market capitalisation of USD30 million. This company would have much more weight compared to a company with a market cap of USD1 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, the price of the index will change drastically as the price of the stock with a higher market cap changes. On the other hand, if a company with a low market cap experiences any change, it would have minimal effect on the stock index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most common index weighting, and most major stock indices use it to calculate their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An equal-weighted index is where stocks are weighed against each other equally, regardless of their price, market capitalisation, or any other factor. This means that every company&rsquo;s performance affects the index equally. Thus, to find the index's price made of 100 stocks, you&rsquo;d need to add up all their prices and divide the sum by 100. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weight of each company in a price-weighted index is determined by its current stock price. Regardless of their size, companies with more expensive stocks would have a heavier weight in the index than those with a lower price. For instance, if the stock index consists of four stocks worth USD10, USD20, USD30 and USD40, the stocks would make up 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total index, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s important to note that each index can have multiple variations. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index, tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US, is usually market-capitalisation-weighted, but there is also an equal-weighted version of it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do stock market indices help traders? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock indices mainly function as economic indicators or market barometers that measure financial health. The average value of stocks in a specific country&rsquo;s stock market shows how well its economy is doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By observing these indices, you get a sense of how the overall market is doing without monitoring individual stocks, and you can evaluate the performance of the market by comparing the current price of an index to its previous price. This allows traders to analyse market trends and understand market sentiment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, traders can also opt to trade on these indices. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular stock market indices on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade on popular stock indices with <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/cfd-trading-vs-options-trading-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a> by predicting the indices&rsquo; market movement and without buying the underlying stocks.

Despite holding above the $1.06 level in the first half of the week, the leading currency pair plunged as low as $1.0366 &ndash; its lowest level since June. Although US dollar bulls rallied throughout the week, recession fears pushed it back. Based on the chart above, the pair ended the week at around $1.0414, establishing a bearish tone with lower lows and lower highs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders were concerned that aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank would tip the global economy into recession. There was a ray of hope, however, that emerged from China lifting its lockdown, alleviating inflation and growth concerns and temporarily favouring US dollar bears.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the recent bearish consolidation re-energised GBP sellers, who smashed GBP/USD below $1.20 for the first time in 2 weeks.

We go through the top benefits of trading in the commodities market and find out how it offers great trading opportunities.","blog_post":"<p>With a wide variety of assets across different levels of volatility, liquidity, and risk, the history-filled <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-are-commodities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodities market</a> offers traders plenty of great trading opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we'll go through why it's a good idea to trade commodities like gold and oil.</p>\n<h2>1. They balance your portfolio</h2>\n<p>Commodities offer a great way to diversify your trading portfolio because they tend to have a low correlation to traditional financial assets such as stocks or currencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Correlation measures how the values of two assets change in relation to each other. When there is a low correlation between two assets, it means that the value of the assets will move in opposite directions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, when the value of stocks drops, the value of commodities will rise. So if you&rsquo;re trading on both stocks and commodities, this helps you to balance your risk across a variety of markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. They protect you against inflation</h2>\n<p>You might have heard the term &ldquo;hedge against inflation&rdquo; when referring to commodities. Think of it like a physical hedge, which acts as a barrier protecting a piece of land. So, when commodities are the &lsquo;hedge&rsquo;, they protect you (the land) from the negative effects of inflation (outside influences).</p>\n<p>Inflation is what happens when purchasing power weakens because of rising prices. One of the main causes of rising prices is an increased demand in goods and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When there&rsquo;s a rising demand for goods, more raw materials (like metals or agricultural products) are needed to produce these goods, which leads to an increase in demand and the value of these materials. This is good news if you trade on them.</p>\n<h2>3. They are a store of value</h2>\n<p>Commodities also provide additional protection for your capital by acting as a store of value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A store of value refers to an asset that usually retains its value over time, without being significantly affected by economic or natural disasters. Precious metals are considered a store of value, or safe haven investments, as they have generally retained their value over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/why-trade-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gold</a> and silver for example, which have been traded for thousands of years and are still considered valuable commodities today. The value of gold increases even in failing economies thanks to increasing demand as people rush to store their wealth in a safe asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. They offer opportunities in a volatile market</h2>\n<p>The commodities market is highly volatile, with huge price fluctuations that can sometimes happen unexpectedly. Some might consider high volatility as a disadvantage when trading &mdash; for example, when prices drop rapidly and you&rsquo;re left with an asset that isn&rsquo;t valuable anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, on Deriv, you can trade <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs (contracts for differences)</a> and options on commodities, which allows you to trade on price movements without owning the physical asset. All you have to do is speculate on an asset&rsquo;s price movements &mdash; whether it&rsquo;ll go up or down &mdash; and earn a payout if the market moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This opens up plenty of exciting opportunities in the commodities market to potentially gain from significant price fluctuations. Plus, you&rsquo;ll be able to benefit from both rising and falling prices, as long as the price moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that a balanced portfolio or a highly volatile market doesn&rsquo;t guarantee profits or protection against losses. Just like when you trade in any other market, trading commodities comes with its own risks and the market can be significantly affected by unpredictable events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/3-tips-to-boost-your-commodities-trading-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tips for trading in the commodities market</a> before you get started.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

Learn about the factors that drive stock prices and make informed decisions when trading.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable place, and not all of its price movements can be explained. However, if you were to analyse the stock market a little deeper, you can observe a few factors that play a part in determining price movements. Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

However, if you trade crypto on Deriv, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it at all because you don&rsquo;t buy the actual cryptocurrency. You open your trades with fiat money. Whether you trade with CFDs, options or multipliers, you only predict the price movements of an asset and get a chance to earn a payout if your prediction is correct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you choose to </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-with-crypto-top-3-myths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trade </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crypto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of fiat money, you will actually own a cryptocurrency, and that's when you need safe storage for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to&nbsp;fiat money, there are two options to keep large amounts of it safe: you either have it in cash or store it in a bank. Cryptocurrency can also be stored in 2 ways: using crypto exchanges and crypto wallets. Both are digital storage, of course, as cryptocurrencies don&rsquo;t have a physical form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, here's an interesting note &ndash; neither crypto exchanges nor crypto wallets actually store cryptocurrency. They only provide secure access to it while the coins are stored on a blockchain. Just like when you use a credit or debit card &ndash; it&rsquo;s not actual fiat money, just a piece of plastic, but it gives you access to the money you stored in a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what's the equivalent of a card when it comes to cryptocurrency and accessing your crypto assets? It's your public and private keys.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are private and public keys in the crypto world?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public and private keys are strings of numbers, letters and other characters (similar to a password) that allow you to perform actions with your cryptocurrencies. A public key is similar to your bank account number &ndash; you can share it with other people, who can then transfer cryptocurrency to you. A private key is like your credit card PIN &ndash; not to be shared with anyone, as it gives access to your crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference in private key management is exactly what differentiates crypto exchanges from crypto wallets.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a crypto exchange?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency exchange is a service that allows you to buy and sell digital coins securely. An example of crypto exchanges on Deriv is </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/cashier/on-ramp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat onramp services</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &ndash; Changelly, Xanpool, or Banxa. These service providers let you exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency. The purchased crypto is deposited right into your Deriv account and can be used for trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-known crypto exchanges, especially when they are officially affiliated with an established broker, are one of the safest options to buy, sell, and trade crypto. However, when it comes to storing large amounts, experts advise against keeping your digital coins at crypto exchanges and broker accounts for an extended period of time due to security concerns. Crypto hacks, although rarely successful, usually target exchanges as they are places where a high concentration of cryptocurrency data flows through. If that happens, you have limited control over the safety of your crypto assets and have to rely on the exchange&rsquo;s service providers entirely to keep them protected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason for the limited control over your own crypto assets lies in private key access. Most cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide it &ndash; the key belongs to an exchange exclusively. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of storage is called custodial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to have full control over your crypto assets, a good way of keeping them safe is to transfer any crypto you don&rsquo;t use for trading to a secure crypto wallet.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a crypto wallet?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency wallet is a software (programme) or hardware (device) that lets you store your digital coins safely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software wallets are also called hot wallets and store your private keys in a programme connected to the internet. Just like almost any software nowadays, it can be accessed via a desktop app, mobile app or web browser. One of the most important features to look for when selecting a software wallet is two-factor authentication (2FA), as it strengthens security and provides ease of use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of hot crypto wallets are non-custodial, which means they give access to the private keys and the responsibility of its safekeeping to the owner. This type of crypto storage is usually considered much safer than custodial crypto exchanges, as long as wallets&rsquo; owners take proper care of them and backup their keys. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that some hot wallets are custodial too, and do not provide access to a private key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, store crypto access offline and are usually no larger than a USB flash drive. This type of wallet is considered a safer option because the device is only connected to the internet when you need to use your crypto, making it much harder to hack. The important security measure, in this case, is just keeping the device safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until very recently, the third type &ndash; a paper wallet, used to be considered the most secure way to protect crypto assets. A paper wallet literally means keeping your private key written or printed on a piece of paper.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

Can they sharpen your trading strategy? Read our blog to find out.","blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jim Alvarez was a forex trader who usually traded major currency pairs. In 2016, when talks of Brexit were making headlines, he decided to include cross-currency pairs in his trading strategy, which enabled him to diversify his portfolio and balance out his risk.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are cross-currency pairs?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs, also known as currency crosses, are currency pairs which don&rsquo;t include the US dollar. In forex,&nbsp; currencies are traded against each other and the most popular are Euro, US dollar, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Pound sterling, Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar. If you exclude the US dollar from the list and trade any of these currencies against each other, you would be trading cross-currency pairs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did cross-currency pairs come to exist?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After World War II, globalisation was setting in, and there was a need to understand how the currencies of different countries ranked against each other. However, this called for a standardised format by which these currencies could be measured. Post-WWII, the US economy and currency ranked among the strongest internationally, and since the US dollar at this time was also linked to gold, it became the world's reserve currency. This means it is usually held by a central bank and is used as a common denomination for international trades and included in the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that happened, if a trader wanted to trade Pound sterling against Euro, they would have to convert Pound sterling to US dollar first and then US dollar to Euro. This created drawbacks and traders were losing out on favourable exchange rates as it took more time to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pace of globalisation increased and the forex market grew, traders wanted to have easy access to several currencies without relying on the US dollar. This is why cross-currency pairs were introduced &ndash; to ensure a seamless conversion of currencies that aren't linked to the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why you should consider adding cross-currency pairs to your trading portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs present multiple trading opportunities, and here are 4 reasons why they can be a beneficial addition to your trading strategy:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trade without being tied to the US dollar</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade currency pairs linked to the US dollar, you are limited to a single prediction of whether the US dollar might go up or down. However, with cross-currency pairs, you can consider other factors that are not affected by the US dollar and discover more trading opportunities. Trading cross-currency pairs can also be a part of your go-to trading strategy if you need to wait out volatile trading conditions with the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Diversify your portfolio&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading different instruments helps you to keep your portfolio varied and may increase your chances of enhanced potential profit. Plus, you also have the chance to trade currency pairs, which are sensitive to price movements in the commodities market because those countries produce and export various goods and services. Keep in mind this strategy depends on thorough research of political, social, and economic factors that influence these trends.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hedging&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hedging is a strategy in which you secure your trade (if the market doesn&rsquo;t move in your favour) by also placing an opposite trade. You can spread out the risk by trading different cross-currency pairs in order to secure yourself against the volatility of cross-currency rates.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase your trade volume during specific world events</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, if you wanted to capitalise on a world event that wasn't tied to the US dollar, you would have to place 2 separate trades, incurring 2 transaction fees. As an example, if you wanted to trade Euro and Pound sterling you would have to pay transaction fees for a EUR/USD trade and a GBP/USD trade. However, with cross-currency pairs, you get to place a trade directly on the currency itself &ndash; EUR/GBP.

In this panel, you can have 4 separate charts of different assets at once, or expand one of them into the full version. You can also customise each chart by right-clicking on it and selecting the &lsquo;Properties&rsquo; tab &ndash; choose how each chart looks, what it shows, and even its colour schemes.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading panel</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trading panel is located at the bottom of the platform. It is a useful feature to keep track of information on your trades. For example, you can see all the open and running trades in the &lsquo;Trade&rsquo; tab, access all the closed trades in the &lsquo;History&rsquo; tab, and check all the notifications in the &lsquo;Journal&rsquo; tab.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the trading panel has &lsquo;News&rsquo; and &lsquo;Calendar&rsquo; tabs that can help you with the fundamental analysis to fine-tune your trading strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the main features of the DMT5 platform used by traders on a regular basis, but the platform has many more functions that can enhance your trading journey.

The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK. Furthermore, the receding resistance line has countered any upside movements by the cable pair since mid-April. The pair now awaits the Fed and Bank of England (BoE)&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions coming later this week for the next directional bias.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair has almost reached the &yen;135 level, hitting over two-decade highs. This price movement can be attributed to relentless dollar demand in the US due to inflation and stronger yields. As a result, the pair came under selling pressure, which caused a drop from the long-term highs.<br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The yellow metal's price went up significantly after a higher-than-expected inflation result.

This discovery has soon turned into a trading discipline, commonly used by traders nowadays.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of chart patterns you can use in your technical analysis, but they all follow the same logic: the support trend line is at the bottom, and the resistance trend line is at the top.

Alternatively, select multipliers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some trade types are offered in a few variations. For example, the In/Out trade has Ends Between/Ends Outside or Stays between/Goes Outside options.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to check this section too, and select your preferred variation.</span></p>\n<h4><strong>Contract type</strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your next step is to decide which contract type you want.

The pair&rsquo;s price increase was largely driven by government bond yields and inflation-related concerns.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the chart above, EUR/USD is priced between the 61.8% and 50% retracement levels near $1.0730 and $1.0713, respectively. On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

On the downside, its support level is at the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,846.47.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI ended the week above $118, marking a gain of over 3%. Additionally, the US job market grew faster than expected in July, indicating that economic growth will continue, thereby boosting crude and refined product demand.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite easing virus restrictions, oil prices have risen as demand has increased. Moreover, supply from one of the three largest producers has been reduced by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Naturally, this transition will enhance the network's scalability, efficiency, and speed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">32,899.70</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">-90.42</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">-0.27%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">12,548.03</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">-94.07</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">-0.74%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">4,108.54</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">-23.61</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">-0.57%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Tuesday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the week, the Dow lost 0.27%, the S&amp;P 500 index declined by 0.57%, and the Nasdaq index shed 0.74%.

Technology has improved market accessibility tremendously, making trading for beginners and for anyone much easier, as long as there&rsquo;s access to the internet using laptops or mobile devices. But just because it is so readily accessible now doesn't mean that you should take online trading lightly, especially if you're a beginner.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to be prepared and aware of the trading basics before diving into it straight away. We've outlined the top 3 tips to help you get started on your journey to becoming a smart trader.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Do your research</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good research is key to online trading, and, as a beginner, your research should focus on two important things &mdash; finding a trustworthy broker and understanding the markets you want to trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selecting a reputable broker is crucial. Make time to read <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about the broker you're eyeing, how they manage thriving markets, and the variety of platforms they offer. Go for a broker that offers user-friendly platforms that are suitable for both beginners and experienced traders. Check out its list of trading assets, so you have options to choose from and can diversify your trading portfolio. Most importantly, verify that the broker is properly licensed and regulated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you decide which broker to trade with, selecting your assets to trade is your next step. The process of choosing the asset to trade doesn't differ much from finding the right broker. It entails time and research as well. Having a solid understanding of each market's assets will help you make deliberate and smart trading decisions. It would help to consider market trends and world events, too, as these factors significantly affect price movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can trade on assets in various markets &mdash; from trading <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> on forex, </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-are-stocks-how-and-where-to-trade-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities to <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptocurrency</a>. Diversifying your portfolio is a smart way to trade because it can protect you from losing all your money in case a market moves against your prediction.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think researching markets could be a bit much for you, you can start trading synthetic indices on Deriv. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/markets/synthetic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Synthetic indices</a> simulate real-world market movement. Its movements are based on a cryptographically secure random number generator audited by an independent third party to ensure they cannot be tampered with or manipulated.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unaffected by natural events and free of market and liquidity risks, synthetic indices offer you the flexibility to trade different synthetic markets with high or low-risk characteristics. These indices are available to trade on Deriv 24/7, even on weekends and public holidays. Go ahead and sign up for a <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv demo account</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;and try trading synthetic indices.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Use a free demo account to test out your trading strategies</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best traders hone their skills through practise and experience, part of which involves handling losses. Most licensed and regulated brokers offer their clients a demo account pre-loaded with virtual funds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demo accounts provide the same trading experience as real accounts, which helps new traders familiarise themselves with the trading platforms.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0f7a68fb-456a-41f8-b59b-f29bae4487ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0f7a68fb-456a-41f8-b59b-f29bae4487ca\" alt=\"Deriv&rsquo;s sign up page\" width=\"1684\" height=\"1232\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demo account for each of the platforms on Deriv will allow you to practise trading before deciding to trade with real money. To <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up a demo account,</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;you simply need to register with Deriv, create your login credentials, and select the demo account option. Your demo account will be credited with 10,000 USD virtual money so that you can open trades, practise trading, and sharpen your strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend you practise your trading strategies on one or more platforms to find one that works best for you and improve your strategies before jumping on a real account.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Enjoy the process and practise patience</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting started can be a real challenge, but it&rsquo;s best to take your time and enjoy the process.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to online trading, patience is critical. Practising patience with your trades may help you discover what strategy works best for you. Never open a trade just for the sake of trading. It would be best to trade only when you&rsquo;re confident with your strategy, considering the external variables that may affect the market you&rsquo;re about to trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's also important to note that to keep a disciplined approach to online trading you should develop a strategy and stick with it. Trades don't usually result in massive payouts. Losses are likely to occur, so stay realistic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many successful traders share the same characteristics. As a beginner, you could marvel at their success but, most importantly, analyse what made them successful.

With research, experience, and patience, you too can navigate your way to trading success.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs on cryptocurrencies are not available for clients residing within the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>","published_date":"2022-06-02"},{"id":"3e6a9fa2-971a-411d-ba58-82e134a1bb74","main_image":{"id":"2cc186a1-a9df-41db-9797-0a61c38d4f9d","description":"Use technical indicators to refine your trading strategy on Deriv.","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a8c8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/cac11/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg","srcSet":"/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/89239/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 150w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/2c227/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 300w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/cac11/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 600w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/751a4/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/49f80/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 150w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/de298/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 300w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/52493/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 600w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/1eb60/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-4-most-common-types-of-technical-indicators","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"259","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"The 4 most common types of technical indicators","blog_description":"Using technical indicators is an efficient way to analyse markets and predict price movements. In this blog, we review the 4 most common groups of indicators.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is technical analysis in trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog post, you may already know that technical indicators are mathematical calculations that can help you predict the price movements of an asset. These calculations evaluate an asset from multiple angles and can become a really powerful tool, providing valuable insights and helping you step up your trading strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are dozens of indicators you can use, but they are usually divided into groups by the type of information they provide. Some indicators may provide multiple sets of information and can therefore belong to more than one group.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we&rsquo;ve grouped indicators into 4 main types and briefly explain how each group helps traders identify trading opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trend indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, trend refers to the direction of the price movement over an extended period of time. For example, when the price is consistently increasing, it's an uptrend, and when it's decreasing, it's a downtrend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trend indicators can help determine the direction the market will take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common trend indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average (MA)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Parabolic stop and reverse (Parabolic SAR)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; The Ichimoku Cloud</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Volume indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, volume refers to the number of trades executed within a particular time frame. It&rsquo;s a direct indication of the asset&rsquo;s supply and demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By measuring the volume of trading, volume indicators indicate whether a trend is likely to last.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, high volume on the uptrend indicates high demand and therefore, a further price increase. It works the same way in the reversed scenario: high volume on the downtrend indicates high supply and a likelihood of a further price drop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common volume indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; On balance volume (OBV)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Accumulation / Distribution indicator</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Money flow index</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Volatility indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volatility in trading determines the degree to which a price moves over time. High volatility indicates fast and unpredictable price changes. Volatility indicators measure the price range of an asset and help to catch the moments of high volatility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many traders favour highly volatile assets and markets because they present numerous trading opportunities along with faster and higher gains.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common volatility indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Bolinger bands</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Donchian channel</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Average true range (ATR)</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Momentum indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momentum in trading refers to the speed of the price change. Momentum indicators measure this speed, which can be helpful to see an upcoming trend change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common momentum indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Relative strength index (RSI)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Stochastic oscillator</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the best way to use technical indicators?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When traders use technical indicators, they usually apply 2-3 of them at once and compare their findings to increase the likelihood of making a correct trading decision. For example, if a trend indicator predicts the change of trend, they check the volume as well to make sure there is enough buying or selling power to support this change. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that technical indicators, just like chart patterns, are still a prediction and don&rsquo;t give 100% accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also always a good idea to test and try different combinations on your risk-free </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first before trading with real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you want to know another non-technical way of analysing financial markets, head to our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fundamental analysis</a>&nbsp;blog post and find out how major political and economic events can affect prices.</span></p>","published_date":"2022-06-02"},{"id":"8f7f9ea1-cee9-42fb-97d3-241ae1b7badf","main_image":{"id":"e32eaa2e-92b8-40d5-a1ce-c46ca2b7b44a","description":"Weekly Market Report – 30 May 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/89239/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 150w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/2c227/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 300w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 600w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/751a4/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/49f80/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 150w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/de298/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 300w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/52493/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 600w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/1eb60/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-05-2022-05-06-2022","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"279","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 30 May 2022","blog_description":"After several weeks of hits and dips, the financial markets finally welcomed some progress.

As seen in the chart above, the price stayed above the 5 and 10 SMA's (now acting as the support levels) towards the end of the week, maintaining an upward momentum.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro recently benefited from rising European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate expectations. Markets are now anticipating a tightening of over 100bps through the end of the year, starting with the first hike in July.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD extended its recovery from two-year lows of $1.2155 in the preceding week, finishing the week at around $1.2631. The widespread US dollar selling pressure fueled the rise in GBP/USD in the second half of the week. This factor led to the currency pair reaching its highest level in a month, at around $1.27.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is far too early to forecast if the US dollar will remain weak for much longer. However, persistent inflation is keeping the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track, allowing them to re-evaluate the effectiveness of its current policy on inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week the focus will be on inflation, with the EU publishing its preliminary estimates of the May Consumer Price Index. To add to that, the US will release the May non-farm payrolls (NFP) report.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/dddc97ea-d198-43ad-bde7-24745dbf8cb8?width=1686&amp;height=823\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/dddc97ea-d198-43ad-bde7-24745dbf8cb8?width=1686&amp;height=823\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

On the road to recovery, gold is aiming to retest its two-week highs while the US dollar struggles to gain ground as market sentiment remains mixed and Treasury yields remain low.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the dismal US GDP and the Pending Home Sales report also contributed to the slowing down of the US economy, making traders reposition themselves ahead of the minutes of the May Fed meeting. Therefore, last week's rally in global stocks also weighed down on the US dollar's safe-haven appeal, benefiting gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the chart for the week, gold is around the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,853. If gold continues to go down, its next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level near $1,850. However, on the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 50% retracement level at around $1,856.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices increased by 3% on Thursday, May 26 2022 &ndash; the most in 2 weeks. This increase is due to a long bet on surging gasoline consumption ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, which marks the start of America's peak driving season on Monday (May 30 2022). The price also increased due to the European government considering whether or not to ban Russian crude oil completely.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" alt=\"ETH/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin currently holds 45.25% of the crypto asset market and has seen an overall price increase of 0.04% in the last seven days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this period, ETH's price dropped by around 10%. This dip is visible in the chart above, along with a sharp drop on Thursday, 26 May 2022, and then it continued to trade sideways for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Altcoins too underperformed over the weekend. Last week, the price of SOL (Solana) dropped by 10.54%, while the price of ADA (Cardano) dropped by 4.78%.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Terra's new blockchain was launched over the weekend. With this new development, the old token would become Luna Classic (LUNC), while the new token would be Luna 2.0 (LUNA). The elaborate proposal involved airdropping new tokens to LUNA and UST tokens holders before the crash. Unfortunately, in the wake of the UST de-pegging debacle, traders appear sceptical about LUNA Classic and LUNA 2.0.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33,212.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,332.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,681.42</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">647.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,158.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">184.49</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street saw its first positive week in nearly 2 months. All 3 major US indexes were in the green as they ended a losing streak that some feared was a prelude to a recession. The Dow climbed by 4.18%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.38%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US markets have mostly had a lousy year as soaring inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic rattled traders and weighed on corporate profits. Until Friday's close, the Dow had fallen for eight consecutive weeks, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq had declined for seven straight weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This jump occurred because the yield on benchmark US Treasuries fell after data showed that US consumer spending rose in April and the uptick in inflation slowed. Both factors are signs that the world's largest economy could be on track to grow this quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, key updates in the labour market are expected, with the release of Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) openings, hires, and separations, ADP private payrolls, and the official May non-farm payrolls report.

There are so many trading terms to learn, a wide range of markets and products to understand, and, of course, one needs to find a trading strategy that will work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account can help you work through the basics in a risk free environment. It allows you to familiarise yourself with different trading platforms and enables you to practise trading skills and strategies using virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a demo account on all of Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms. You can get started with&nbsp; 10,000 USD virtual money, which you can top up any time you run out. You&rsquo;ll be able to open positions on your preferred trading platform to get a good grasp of how it works and explore the available assets to trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A demo account can also help you with the other aspects of trading, including:</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of risk management</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people go into financial trading with a &ldquo;get it all at once&rdquo; mindset. After a few wins, they go all-in with their capital, hoping to make a fortune in one transaction, which eventually results in more losses than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you can practise your trades however you want since it&rsquo;s risk-free. You can go all in all at once if you wish to without worrying about losing money, allowing you to build a strategy on how you can trade carefully and manage risks appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore your risk management skills, creating a demo account on Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform is a great way to do so. With DTrader, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you get to trade with multipliers on forex, synthetic indices, and cryptocurrency.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers has features</a> such as stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation. These features allow you to customise your trades based on your risk appetite and trade strategies.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>In-depth market analysis</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several financial markets on which you can trade on Deriv </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; forex, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and synthetic indices. These markets have different characteristics, given the various elements, such as world events, that could affect them. That's why it's crucial to study the market movements with the help of market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you get the opportunity to analyse how each of these markets work, not only to widen your knowledge about each market but also to understand past trades' outcomes better. Plus, you won't risk losing real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demo account, you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of how the market works on real live trading platforms; the only difference is you don&rsquo;t need to spend real funds. It comes equipped with features and tools that trading platforms have, including indicators, real-time quotes, charting tools, journals, news feeds, and more. As you practise trading while analysing the market movements more closely, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to make smarter trading decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example of an online trading platform with all these features is <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can set up a demo account under your preferred account type &mdash; Synthetics, Financial, and Financial STP &mdash; and start practising how to execute and monitor your trades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Synthetics account, you can trade CFDs on Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices 24/7, which simulate real-world market movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Financial account, you can trade major and minor currency pairs, commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, &amp; indices with leverage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas with a Financial STP account, you get to trade major, minor, and exotic currency pairs and cryptocurrencies with tight spreads and higher trade volumes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Developing a plan</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account also helps you to understand the importance of planning out your trades. For instance, if you've already created or learned some strategies, your demo account allows you to practise and fine-tune them. Doing so will help you figure out which strategy works best for you and evaluate the potential outcomes that you'll get if you stick with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is the right time to switch to a real account?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" alt=\" A woman contemplating between a demo and real account.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no definite answer to this question, but these signs may help you decide if it's time to use a real account:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You've found a winning strategy.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If over 50% of your positions are winning trades, this may be a sign your strategy is working. Simply put, it means your trading profits are higher than your losses. If you have defined the markets you want to trade on and are confident about your trading strategy, then it's time to put it to the test in the real-world trading environment.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Your fund management skills have improved.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that you can balance your wins and losses, it just shows that you gained a good understanding of how to manage your funds. Proper fund management will help you prevent further losses. The truth is, even the most experienced traders make mistakes with money management, and learning this skill might take you some time, but it is achievable. Once you decide to switch to a real account, ensure you have sufficient funds for a considerable time and manage it properly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You manage your emotions more effectively.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you are able to trade without giving in to your emotional reactions, you may take it as a good sign to go for a real account. Keeping your emotions in check is highly important, as they can significantly influence your decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not get too worried or panic if some of your trades don't go well. After the disappointment, take a break and let your emotions settle. Don't get too excited after a win, either. If you feel like you're on a winning streak, you may be impulsive and open additional positions. Being able to detach yourself from your trades is a crucial part of becoming a successful trader.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;ve learned about the benefits of having a demo account, it&rsquo;s time to get started and create your free <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv demo account</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&rsquo;ll only take you a few minutes, and you&rsquo;ll get to practise trading risk-free using the virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to discover which traits successful traders share and how they plan out their trading strategy, check out our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/useful-tips-on-how-to-trade-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Useful tips on how to trade online blog post</a> based on an ebook written by veteran trader Vince Stanzione, \"7 Traits of Successful Financial Traders.\"</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthetic and Financial STP accounts on the DMT5 platform are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>","published_date":"2022-05-26"},{"id":"5aacdc62-639c-4bd1-94a1-dc8d7f842c10","main_image":{"id":"14379cd6-dfc7-491e-8899-25de31ee5861","description":"Weekly Market Report – 23 May 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/89239/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 150w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/2c227/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 300w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 600w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/751a4/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/49f80/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 150w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/de298/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 300w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/52493/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 600w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/1eb60/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-23-05-2022-29-05-2022","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"277","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 23 May 2022","blog_description":"A risk-averse market environment sent Bitcoin into a frenzy and impacted gold’s start to the week.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EUR/USD finished the week with solid gains just below the $1.06 mark. Although risk-aversion persists, the leading cause of this rally was the weakening US dollar. Moreover, recent inflation rates have doubled central banks' comfort levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another factor that may have contributed to the pair&rsquo;s rise is the European Central Bank. With an interest rate hike in July now being a possibility, several government council members have declared their willingness to increase interest rates as soon as possible. In fact, according to financial analysts, the odds of a 50 bps rise at the start of the third quarter have risen from 40% to 52%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week the GBP/USD pair crossed into positive territory for the first time in over a month, allowing traders to breathe a sigh of relief. As seen in the chart above, GBP/USD started the week around the $1.23 mark, dipped and recovered to end the week near $1.25.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the UK data releases are strong, they still shed light on the massive problem the Bank of England (BoE) faces over the next few months. Based on 9% inflation data, the BoE suggests the inflation rate may even reach double digits in the coming months before dropping in late 2022/2023. On the other hand, the US dollar failed to capitalise on the Fed's hawkish comments, and US Treasury yields rose, sending GBP/USD higher to test the $1.25 level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, USD/JPY attracted some dip-buying near the &yen;127.15 level, though a modest US dollar weakness kept further gains in check. Furthermore, a generally positive tone in the equity markets also weakened the safe-haven Japanese yen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" alt=\"BTC/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

This slump can be attributed to multiple factors such as rising inflation, the Fed's increase in interest rates, and the Russia-Ukraine war.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin started the week marginally above the $31,000 mark. Then the largest cryptocurrency in the world fluctuated wildly and ended the week just under the $30,000 mark. The chart above depicts the 50% retracement level acted as the primary resistance level, and the 38.2% retracement level acted as the primary support level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Tuesday and Thursday, Bitcoin's prices kept bouncing back and forth off the 50% retracement level at $29,978.84 and the 76.4% retracement level at $30,671.58, which acted as its primary support and resistance levels, respectively. It then broke free and entered a dive below the $29,000 mark on both days.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, other cryptocurrencies have given traders some respite, ending the week with slight gains. Altcoins such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Litecoin increased by 1.1%, 7.4% and 7.2%, respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The aftermath of Terra's collapse has seen major cryptocurrency companies, such as Binance disclose information about their previous investments in the ecosystem and subsequent losses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other cryptocurrency-related news, the Federal Finance Ministry of Germany has guided the income tax treatment of cryptocurrency.

However, it gained an upward momentum due to declining US yields and the US dollar&rsquo;s demand being impacted by the disappointing earnings figures and bleak sales prospects from large retailers in the US. For the first time since mid-April, XAU/USD recorded weekly gains.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, after the announcement of zero coronavirus infections across all districts in Shanghai, the yellow metal managed to rebound and enjoy temporary relief as its price increased to reach near the $1,830 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As seen in the chart above, gold ended its week near $1,846, swaying upwards midweek and is currently above its moving average, which acts as its support level. The 5-day SMA and 10-day SMA are around $1,844 and $1,842, respectively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, oil prices comfortably remained within recent ranges and aren&rsquo;t trading with much conviction. A lack of new major crude oil-relevant fundamental developments in the last week may have resulted in the WTI moving in the $105-115ish ranges. Furthermore, the proposed EU ban on Russian oil imports still hasn&rsquo;t secured the unanimous agreement amongst EU member nations that needed to go into force.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong><br /><br /></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,261.90</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-961.52</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.98%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,835.62</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-407.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.33%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,901.36</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-106.65</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.66%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Markets continued to face downward pressure, with Wednesday, 18 May 2022, marking the biggest one-day decline in the S&amp;P 500 index since June 2020. Equity markets have continued to slip for the seventh week in a row and closed the week down by about 20% year-to-date putting it on the track to the bear-market territory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The losses were driven by concerns about inflation after a series of disappointing earnings reports from major retailers. In particular, Walmart reported lower than expected operating margins on higher input costs from freight and fuel. Traders seem to interpret these earnings as a signal that the worst is yet to come. Additionally, fears of a recession have been driven by rising inflation, supply-chain issues, and the Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates aggressively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As traders' concerns pile up, stocks have been struggling to recover over the last 7 weeks.

Find more about this ongoing competition in our blog.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking services are an essential part of our lives. We get paid, pay the bills, and swipe our bank cards at grocery stores all the time. In one way or another, almost every financial operation we do goes through a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, despite its vital necessity, the banking industry is confronted with some fierce competition. The emerging non-traditional banking trend is slowly taking over the market, and many believe it to be more aligned with evolving consumer needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The take-off point of the competition</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crisis of 2008 was one of the worst economic disasters for the entire world. Once the dust settled, it didn&rsquo;t take long to find out that the market collapse was triggered by incompetent actions by the banks.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the entire financial industry derailed, banks began actively investing in hedge funds, using their clients&rsquo; money. To raise more funds for this financial activity, they started signing off too many mortgages without conducting background checks. When the borrowers stopped paying, the artificially-created housing bubble burst, wrecking the entire industry along the way. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millions of people were affected, including those with no mortgages at all.&nbsp; Banks used their savings for investing with a high risk of no return and weren&rsquo;t able to cover the deficit without the cash injection from the homeowners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was never a secret that when you keep your money in the bank, as a long-term deposit, for example, your resources are being used to fund other financial operations. However, when the crisis struck, it became apparent that there were no limitations or solid policy behind such utilisation. Consumer&rsquo;s trust in bank services was broken. People were in need of safer solutions to manage their finances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&rsquo;s when non-traditional banking started growing rapidly to fill the void. A little more than a decade later, temporary bank closures, caused by the worldwide pandemic and global lockdowns, served as a fertiliser to an already gaining popularity trend.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what are these non-traditional banks?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we are presented with a wide range of alternatives to the good old traditional bank account. Real estate trust funds, fintech companies, or neobanks that operate solely online without any physical location are just some non-traditional banks examples. Even well-known tech giants like Google and Amazon provide money transfer services that exclude traditional banks entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new institutions offer lower fees, faster services, full transparency of transactions, extra services and a more wholesome customer service approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite growing popularity, it&rsquo;s still questionable whether non-traditional banks are here to replace traditional banking. After all, the majority of alternative banks are still tied to regular banks due to licensing regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, it looks like traditional banking is not going to give up easily.&nbsp;With the strong competition breathing down their necks, banks have no other choice but to refine their services. Interactive and user-friendly mobile apps, a growing number of extra services, and increasing accessibility reveal the determination to keep up with the evolving demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So who is leading in this race? In a modern, ever-changing world, it&rsquo;s quite hard to identify the winner or even predict the outcome of this confrontation. But we certainly need to be ready to embrace any possible scenario. And that&rsquo;s our strategy at Deriv.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does Deriv keep up with the non-traditional banking trend?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international fintech companies like us, it&rsquo;s too early to talk about discarding traditional banking entirely. That&rsquo;s why we are focused on blending both traditional and non-traditional services to provide our clients with alternatives according to their preferences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, we offer multiple deposit and withdrawal options that include both traditional and non-traditional banking &ndash; regular bank transfers, digital or crypto wallets, and peer-to-peer solutions. Our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/an-easy-guide-on-how-to-buy-crypto-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat to crypto exchange</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the latest trends Deriv has embraced to bridge the two worlds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of services our client chooses, we keep their money completely segregated from company funds to ensure its safety. Clients are free to track the movement of their funds and to withdraw them whenever they want because they aren&rsquo;t merged with the company&rsquo;s funds or used for business interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also strive to be as accessible and supportive to our clients as possible to make sure they are always up to date and have access to high-quality modern solutions. That&rsquo;s why we are continuously working on introducing new platforms, mobile apps, products, and services to deliver a reliable and seamless on-the-go experience. And our customer support is available round the clock to help with technical difficulties or general questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So whether non-traditional banks will take over the industry eventually or some new trend will emerge in the nearest future, we&rsquo;ve got your back.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat to crypto exchange and peer-to-peer solutions are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","published_date":"2022-05-19"},{"id":"ef8fe3ff-97e8-43f8-a244-bcc1a50f3852","main_image":{"id":"824d8386-3721-4a32-8251-6018400cc401","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/89239/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.jpg 150w,\n/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/2c227/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.jpg 300w,\n/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.jpg 600w,\n/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/751a4/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/49f80/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.webp 150w,\n/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/de298/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.webp 300w,\n/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/52493/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.webp 600w,\n/static/a1b3973889e02d69857eafa35d0b82a7/1eb60/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2016%20May%202022.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-16-05-2022-22-05-2022","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"271","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 16 May 2022","blog_description":"Last week, the crypto sector lost over $270 billion and EUR/USD saw a 5-year low.

A recovery in equity prices weakened the greenback, which had a negative effect across the board.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUR/USD fell to $1.035 (the weakest it's been in 5 years), on Thursday, 12 May 2022, amid worries of a recession and the interest rate differential between the monetary policies of the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank. The Euro came under severe pressure on Thursday, 12 May 2022, after several bearish geopolitical developments surrounding relations and trade with Russia regarding energy had taken place.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chart above replicates this drop on Thursday, 12 May 2022. We can see the price fell below its support levels to act as the new resistance level. The pair picked up from the bounce but only saw a flat trend to end the week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the EUR/USD pair rebounded from its lowest intraday level since 2017 and climbed back above $1.04 late on Friday, 13 May 2022. This bounce-back was due to an improvement in risk sentiment and a correction of the US dollar.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD ended the week at approximately $1.2160, falling further by 0.3% on Friday, 13 May 2022, and taking its weekly losses to around 1.4%. In the past 4 weeks, the pair has seen losses totalling approximately 7.0%. In particular, the pound ended the day at its lowest since November 2020, when the UK was in a coronavirus lockdown.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD was under heavy pressure last week caused by the strong safe-haven asset US dollar and because of a combination of bearish factors arising from the UK and Europe. Data showed that inflation has slowed, and underlying price pressures remain elevated, weighing on traders' sentiment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD/JPY is gradually moving higher and is expected to reclaim the mark of &yen;130.00 as traders brace themselves for a hawkish tone from Federal Reserve's chair Jerome Powell on the coming Tuesday, 17 May 2022. The speech from Fed Chair Powell will shed some light on the Fed's monetary policy stance in its June interest rate announcement.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen is facing pressure after the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) Governor, Harihuko Kuroda, promised a conservative monetary policy in the future. This statement was published on Friday, 13 May 2022, highlighting that the economy has not yet achieved its pre-pandemic growth levels, and inflation is still not at par with the targeted levels.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The economic calendar for next week is fairly light as US retail sales and EU inflation data are likely to steal the spotlight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e42bfcc0-4c01-4700-8eb4-050d986b5e26?width=2328&amp;height=1224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e42bfcc0-4c01-4700-8eb4-050d986b5e26?width=2328&amp;height=1224\" alt=\"Terra chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The global crypto market capitalisation saw a decline of nearly 27% in the market volume on Thursday alone.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world's most popular cryptocurrency fell by more than 10% in a single day. On Thursday, 12 May 2022, the price of Bitcoin dropped to around $26,000, its lowest level since December 2020. It steadied at about $30,000 on Friday, 13 May 2022, but that was still less than half of Bitcoin's price last November &ndash; $69,000. However, the weekly net change in Bitcoin volatility was the highest in the two years.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent decline in stablecoins has made crypto markets vulnerable. As per a Bloomberg report, the wipeout of algorithmic stablecoin Terra/USD and its sister token Luna knocked more than $270 billion off the crypto sector's total trillion-dollar value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stablecoins have been viewed as a safe harbour among cryptocurrencies because the value of many stablecoins is pegged to a government-backed currency, such as the US dollar, or precious metals such as gold.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this week, Terra experienced the unexpected. Terra's problems began with withdrawals from Anchor, a platform that supported this stablecoin. Since Friday, 13 May 2022, Anchor's total deposits have fallen from $14 billion to $2.2 billion. Along with concerns about cryptocurrencies as a whole, and the drop in Bitcoin's price, Terra started to lose its peg to the US dollar.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After beginning the week on Monday at $66, the coin Luna was trading at approximately $0.0002 on Friday, 13 May 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Polkadot dipped by over 3% in market cap and over 26% in volumes. Solana dropped by over 2% in market cap and 25.5% in volumes, while Avalanche slipped by over 3% in market cap and fell by nearly 32% in volumes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/981d5be4-0016-4f1f-bc04-5d7d0358f01f?width=2756&amp;height=1340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/981d5be4-0016-4f1f-bc04-5d7d0358f01f?width=2756&amp;height=1340\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

According to Jerome Powell, the FOMC is expecting 2 more 50 basis point rate hikes in June and July, which indicates they will do more if data \"turns the wrong way.\" As a result, the US Dollar Index hit a nearly two-decade high of around $105.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a technical perspective, gold prices continued to decline and have attempted to go below the $1,800 mark, extending the bearish trend. On Friday, 13 May 2022, gold traded sideways near its two-month low of $1,810. Although gold briefly fell below $1,800 in the American session, it managed to recoup some of its daily losses and ended the week at around $1,812.15. This recovery came after the University of Michigan's monthly publication revealed that consumer confidence in the United States fell in early May.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the hourly chart for the week, if gold continues to decline, its support level would be near $1,807.07. Additionally, due to the recoup, it managed to stay slightly above the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1,810.65 and $1,810.90, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders are also concerned that a more aggressive move by major central banks to contain inflation could harm global economic growth and precipitate a recession. Furthermore, shockingly poor Chinese macro data exacerbated the fears and, when combined with the resurgence of geopolitical tensions, weighed on risk sentiment, forcing traders to seek refuge in traditional safe-haven assets. This shift may provide some support for the safe-haven metal. Aside from that, the yellow metal's attractiveness as an inflation hedge may help limit further losses for the XAU/USD, at least for the time being.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the oil market has been volatile this week, falling below $100 amid concerns about the US and global economic slowdown, which could reduce demand for crude. However, oil seemed to have recovered most of those losses recently, as sharply falling US inventories of refined fuels combined with ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine shifts the market's focus back to the supply side.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, market participants will be looking for clues about the possibility of a 75-bps rate hike from remarks by several FOMC officials, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This economic event, in turn, will have a significant impact on the near-term USD price dynamics and provide a new directional boost to gold.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this, Foreign ministers from the EU will meet in Brussels to discuss the next round of Russian sanctions, and diplomats have floated the idea of delaying a proposed ban on its oil imports in response to Hungary's objections. According to government officials, Germany intends to stop importing Russian crude by the end of the year if the EU fails to agree on coordinated action.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">32,196.66</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-49.04</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.15%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,387.40</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">199.68</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,023.89</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">32.65</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.82%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Indices had a mixed week as traders grew increasingly doubtful that the Federal Reserve could prevent a recession by raising interest rates enough.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the Fed's policy change, the consumer price index (CPI) was expected to show a slowing in inflation, giving traders relief. CPI rose by 8.3% in April compared to 8.5% in March, while core prices (excluding food and energy) rose by 6.2% versus 6.5%. The 0.6% monthly gain in the core index was of particular interest, with it being the largest gain in 3 months. Moreover, rates for rentals and airline fares rose by 0.6% and 18.6%, respectively, as travel demand rebounded strongly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, the US government bond prices recovered modestly on Friday, 13 May 2022, with the 10-year US Treasury bond yield falling to around 2.93%. The 10-year yield had risen to 3.13% in the previous week after breaking through the 3% barrier for the first time since November 2018. It may be that the inverse correlation between stocks and treasuries is returning as stocks fell significantly this week, explaining the fall in yields as a whole and the increase in the Treasury prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, the main drivers of the market are the Fed's accelerated pace of monetary tightening, persistently high inflation data, concerns about slowing growth, and disruptions caused by China's strict COVID-19 lockdowns.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></p>\n<p><em>Terra (UST/USD) and Luna (TER/USD) are not available for trading on our platforms.</em></p>\n<p><em>This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</em></p>","published_date":"2022-05-16"},{"id":"9d7c2ef3-7095-4b81-8d70-1ecb46e58fbe","main_image":{"id":"aec386bc-8cc1-40c3-8886-76dac19028b4","description":"Cryptocurrency trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#880888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/cac11/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/89239/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 150w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/2c227/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 300w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/cac11/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 600w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/751a4/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/49f80/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 150w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/de298/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 300w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/52493/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 600w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/1eb60/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"get-on-the-cryptocurrency-action","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_uk","tags":[{"id":"191","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}}],"blog_title":"Why do you need to get in on the cryptocurrency action?","blog_description":"Wondering why the entire world is going crazy about cryptocurrencies? Here are the main benefits of using crypto that will make you want to have it too","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people are familiar with cryptocurrencies to some extent today. It's hard to miss the headlines about it, whether you already own crypto or have never considered having it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many people still prefer using good old fiat currency &mdash; paper money issued by a government. Are you missing out on something important if you don&rsquo;t have crypto?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While fiat currency is not going anywhere anytime soon, cryptocurrency can be a good investment in the future. Let&rsquo;s explore why.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of using crypto</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advantage of the cryptocurrency world is its decentralisation. It means that virtual money is not issued and not controlled by any government, which makes digital coins completely independent. Cryptocurrencies are immune to inflation, bank failures and monetary policies of the governments. Aside from this, there are a number of other advantages of using these decentralised currencies:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Value</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to inflation, fiat currencies lose their value and buying power over time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The global yearly inflation rate can be anywhere from 1% to 10% and higher, depending on the economic situation. So, 100 USD deposited into your fiat account will have a lower value a year later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, cryptocurrency is a highly volatile market with big price fluctuations. It means if you invest the same 100 USD in it, its value can either increase or decrease over time. However, the value of the majority of digital coins has increased significantly over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, people who bought one Bitcoin in 2011 with 1 USD and kept it until today have thousands of dollars in value for the same digital coin at the moment of writing. Although it experienced a few upward and downward price swings, it has never dropped back to 1 USD, multiplying the value of the initial investment thousands of times.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Security</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the cryptocurrency world has witnessed some hacking attacks, they were targeting crypto wallets, while the virtual currencies and technology behind them are still highly secure and cannot be hacked. There is no way to make a fake cryptocurrency or steal your identity to use the digital coins you own. Nobody can show up at the bank with a weapon and demand giving them all the crypto it has.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency transactions are also irreversible, which adds an extra level of security. Unlike regular debit and credit card transactions, which face fraud activities frequently nowadays, cryptocurrency is not exposed to this risk. Once a transaction is completed and digital coins are transferred to a new account, they cannot be recalled unless the recipient decides to transfer them back.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Convenience</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat currencies are limited to the borders of the countries using them. For example, the USD is accepted worldwide, but in many countries, you still need to change it to a local currency to be able to use your money. Cryptocurrencies have similar prices everywhere, regardless of the country and continent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, cryptocurrency transactions are very fast, and the majority of them are still considered inexpensive. You don&rsquo;t have to wait 3-4 business days and pay a high fee to receive the transferred amount like you normally do with regular bank transfers. You can also transfer a tiny fraction of cryptocurrency, up to the 100th million part of it, unlike fiat transfers that require a minimum amount.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know why crypto is such a hot topic and why you need to get in on the crypto action, head on to the </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-with-crypto-top-3-myths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading with crypto: Top 3 myths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog.

Click to see full size</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">EUR/USD</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The EUR/USD pair had a volatile week, ending at around $1.0547, not far from the year-to-date low of $1.0470. While the pair recovered some of its previous weekly losses, it remains bearish overall.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last week, central banks took centre stage as overheating inflation continues to spiral out of control and monetary tightening becomes the new normal. On Wednesday, 4th May 2022, the Federal Reserve of the United States approved a half-point increase in interest rates (50 bps), which is twice as large as the quarter-point increase approved in March and the biggest hike since 2000. It was also announced that the bank will begin reducing its balance sheet on 1st June.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The announcement, which was broadly expected, triggered little reaction from financial markets. However, with Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, all hell broke loose as he dismissed potential 75-bps hikes. Investors applauded the \"less aggressive\" stance, but Wall Street rallied, dragging high-yielding currencies with it to the detriment of the US dollar. Following the announcement, the EUR/USD pair reached a weekly high of $1.0626 before falling to a weekly low of $1.0487 the next day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Furthermore, market participants realised that while the Fed may not have been more aggressive than expected, it is the one imposing the most stringent measures. The European Central Bank has mentioned July as a possible date for a rate hike, but by then, the Fed would have likely pulled the trigger again by 50 basis points. In the long run, the imbalance between central banks may continue to favour the US dollar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The crisis in Eastern Europe is another significant factor weighing on the common currency. Russian aggression against Ukraine continues unabated. Even after the sixth round of sanction announcements, the European Union still has not agreed on a full oil embargo, despite its ongoing struggle to replace Russian energy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the technical side, EUR/USD went up modestly by 0.42%. As per the week&rsquo;s hourly chart, EUR/USD is currently near the 38.2% retracement level at around the $1.0540 mark, acting as the support level. If it breaches its support level, the next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level at around the $1.0519 mark. On the flip side, the current resistance level is at the 50% retracement level at around $1.0556, followed by the next resistance level at the 61.8% retracement level at around $1.0573. &nbsp;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">GBP/USD</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For the GBP/USD pair, the Fed-BOE contrast remained in play as the UK's dire economic outlook widened the economic divergence alongside the monetary. GBP/USD remained relatively stable throughout the week before plunging to new 22-month lows below $1.23, dropping for the third week in a row.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Bank of England (BoE) raised interest rates by 0.25% to 1% on Thursday, 5th May 2022 in line with market expectations, but warned that inflation could reach double digits in the third quarter and growth could fall into negative territory in 2023. This double whammy of bad news sent the already weak British pound tumbling lower, with any minor recoveries being sold off again.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week&rsquo;s focus would be on inflation, with the CPI report scheduled on 11th May 2022 and the UK&rsquo;s GDP scheduled on 12th May 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong><strong>Deriv X</strong></strong></a> Financial account.</p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a1fc4539-b1e0-4663-9c75-d73ffc623941?width=1695&amp;height=870\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a1fc4539-b1e0-4663-9c75-d73ffc623941?width=1695&amp;height=870\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Although the yellow metal managed to recover in the second half of the week, broad-based dollar strength prevented gold from breaking its three-week losing streak.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On Wednesday, 4th May 2022, after the Fed announced the increased policy rate by 50 basis points and dismissed the possibility of 75-bps rate hikes, gold started to rebound, climbing to a 5-day high at around the $1,900 mark. But it couldn&rsquo;t maintain its momentum due to the stock market sell-off and the strengthening of the US dollar. Another reason gold was unable to gain traction last week was due to rising US yields.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As per the hourly chart for the week, gold ended its week at around the $1,883 mark between the 50% and 61.8% retracement levels at around $1,880 and $1,887, acting as the support and resistance levels respectively. If the support level is breached, its next support level would be at the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,874. If the resistance level is breached, the next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1,894.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gold may struggle to make a decisive move in either direction ahead of this week's key US inflation data.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cryptocurrency market saw a major decline during the course of last week, with Bitcoin spearheading the trend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin started the week trading sideways. On 4th May 2022, investors saw a glimmer of hope when Bitcoin almost grazed the $40,000 mark. However, this was short lived when the cryptocurrency plummeted to the $36,000 mark on 6th May 2022, as you can see from the chart. The short term moving averages SMA 5, SMA 10, and SMA 15 kept changing roles of key supports and resistances. The trio of moving averages converged and diverged repeatedly to end the week at $34,352, $34,432, and $34,510 respectively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The world&rsquo;s most popular cryptocurrency broke from its wave-like crest and trough pattern in the previous week and entered a nosedive, to slip for 4 consecutive days and end the week around the $34,000 mark. The digital currency is down 50% from its all-time high of nearly $68,000 in November 2021.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Barring stablecoins that are pegged to the US dollar, all major cryptocurrencies and altcoins followed the Bitcoin bandwagon into their lows. Ethereum dropped by 4%, Terra tumbled 6%, Avalanche plunged 5%, and Dogecoin traded 7.5% lower.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The downtrend experienced by the cryptocurrency market can be attributed to several reasons. The broad stock-sell in the US last week caused havoc in the cryptocurrency world, and major cryptocurrencies followed the downtrend of the equity markets. In addition, investors reacted to the increase in the interest rates by the Fed Reserve, its steepest increase in 2 decades in a battle against inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Russia-Ukraine war continues to impact investor sentiments, who are increasingly abandoning riskier assets and parking their funds in safe haven assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In other cryptocurrency related news, Portugal remains what people call the &lsquo;crypto heaven&rsquo; as other European countries impose regulations and obligations on digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Italian luxury fashion brand Gucci has announced that it will start accepting cryptocurrency payments in the US this month, as reported by Bloomberg.

This can be seen by the Consumer Price Index report, due to be released on Wednesday, 11th May 2022, which will show whether the US economy experienced any relief from surging inflation in April. A month earlier, the government reported that inflation accelerated in March to an annual rate of 8.5%, the highest since 1981, surpassing the previous month's figure of 7.9%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>* Gucci is not available for trading for Deriv clients.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</em></p>","published_date":"2022-05-09"},{"id":"973f141d-0c14-4fb3-9204-61d212a5c294","main_image":{"id":"b112cc94-a7c9-4e60-b970-a0ccbd3af563","description":"Setting up a first trading bot with DBot","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/cac11/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.jpg","srcSet":"/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/89239/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.jpg 150w,\n/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/2c227/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.jpg 300w,\n/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/cac11/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.jpg 600w,\n/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/751a4/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/49f80/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.webp 150w,\n/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/de298/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.webp 300w,\n/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/52493/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.webp 600w,\n/static/54e3c1a677a8a89fe47e6c29dc23307a/1eb60/An%20introduction%20to%20DBot%20%E2%80%93%20Deriv%E2%80%99s%20trading%20bot.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"an-introduction-to-dbot-derivs-trading-bot","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_eu_uk","tags":[{"id":"226","tags_id":{"tag_name":"DBot"}},{"id":"227","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Forex"}},{"id":"228","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Synthetic indices"}},{"id":"229","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Stocks & stock indices"}}],"blog_title":"An introduction to DBot – Deriv’s trading bot","blog_description":"DBot lets you enjoy automated trading without any coding skills.

This gives beginners </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an opportunity to start trading and learn concepts in a practical and cost-effective</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way.

In other words, if you are confident about how the market will move in just a few seconds, DTrader allows you to make a quick entry and exit. Besides that, DTrader offers you an opportunity to place multiple trades on different markets, and with different trade types simultaneously to potentially profit from small price fluctuations.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.

It dropped from over $1,930 to under $1,900 at the start of the week, followed by a stabilising period where it bounced back and forth around the $1,900 mark.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Midweek, the SMA 50 acted as a support level for gold, preventing further downfall. However, the yellow metal soon slipped free of that grip and fell further to a two-month low of $1,872. Currently, it's trading marginally above the $1,900 mark, and the SMA 50 and SMA 100 are converging around the $1,890 level.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Oil</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A strong decline at the onset of the week broke on oil as well.

However, the digital currency heavyweight plummeted by over $2,000 soon after, washing away all hopes of a recovery run. The correlation between Bitcoin price and Nasdaq has been striking this earning season.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever since its massive drop during the start of the week, Bitcoin has been recuperating and slowly making its way back to the $40,000 mark, as seen in the chart above.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Towards the end of the week, it was trading at around the $39,500 mark, nearly bisecting its SMA 50 and SMA 100, which were at $39,664.64 and $39,305.25, respectively. The 2 moving averages have switched roles, playing support and resistance at different times during the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Major altcoins such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin dovetailed with the master cryptocurrency and showed near-identical patterns as well. Although slowly making their way back to their level at the start of the week, Dogecoin is the biggest laggard, having seen the least recovery since the slump.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, the total cryptocurrency market capitalisation saw a massive decline when most major cryptocurrencies plunged, in the first half of the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Crypto news</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of Canada is working on its own central bank digital currency. The bank chief has confirmed that the Canadian dollar will stay at the foundation of the country&rsquo;s financial system. In other developments, more workers in the United States will be able to park their 401(k) retirement savings in Bitcoin.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Middle East, Dubai has been attracting major cryptocurrency firms, following the announcement of the first law governing digital currency in March. Additionally, the Central African Republic lawfully accepted Bitcoin as its legal tender.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the beginning of April, Bitcoin has not seen massive gains. However, the continued receptivity from world regulators is indicative of its long-term stronghold.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In response to a string of bad trading days this week, traders have stepped up, pushing stocks higher ahead of earnings reports ending the week with split sentiments.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Facebook</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Strong earnings from tech companies like Facebook (Meta) boosted overall market sentiment as it went up by around 14% despite a revenue miss, a result of traders and analysts digesting the company's plans to cut spending. Moreover, Meta's Facebook app has gained users once again, with daily active users rising by 4% to 1.96 billion after losing 1 million users in the previous quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Twitter</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter for $44 billion was another highlight of the week. Stock price rose by 5.9% to $51.79 with a reported $513.3 million increase in first-quarter net income, a remarkable jump from $68 million in the same period in 2021, just days after being sold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company reported a 16% increase in daily active users to 229 million. US users increased by 6.4% year on year to 39.6 million at the end of the first quarter, while international users increased by 18.1% to 189.4 million.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Indices market news</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield rising to around 2.80%. The Q1 economic growth rate in the United States was -1.4%, lower than the consensus expectation of 1.1%. Despite this, several underlying trends continued to be strong.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal consumption increased by 2.7% for the quarter, indicating that the housing and business sectors of the US economy remained solid. Low net exports, a slower build-up of inventories, and less fiscal spending were the growth stumbling blocks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The market mood is improving, but the macroeconomic backdrop remains tense, such as China&rsquo;s lockdown due to a Coronavirus outbreak and the US central bank&rsquo;s move to raise interest rates to fight rising inflation. Some tech stocks, which performed well during the expansionary monetary policy era caused by the pandemic, may still be vulnerable to rising interest rates.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</em></span></p>","published_date":"2022-05-02"},{"id":"ddefedfb-a4e9-4f56-ae50-15a917d607c3","main_image":{"id":"9b1a5878-939e-4b67-8da7-b27502cb5ea8","description":"What affects cryptocurrency prices","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#281868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/cac11/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.jpg","srcSet":"/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/89239/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.jpg 150w,\n/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/2c227/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.jpg 300w,\n/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/cac11/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.jpg 600w,\n/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/751a4/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/49f80/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.webp 150w,\n/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/de298/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.webp 300w,\n/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/52493/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.webp 600w,\n/static/07702bd374090a97b21d4009fe12b6ad/1eb60/What%20affects%20cryptocurrency%20prices.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"what-affects-cryptocurrency-prices","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_uk","tags":[{"id":"236","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}},{"id":"237","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"What affects cryptocurrency prices?","blog_description":"Wondering how to improve your cryptocurrency trading strategy?

The answer to this question is yes as well as no. Some of these factors apply to the crypto market too, but there are also a number of crypto-specific events that influence the price movements of this market.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let's take a closer look.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common factors</span></h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Supply and demand</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The law of supply and demand can be a good indicator of cryptocurrency price movements.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the availability of cryptocurrencies depends on how many are in circulation at a particular time. So increased coin circulation leads to supply becoming bigger than demand, causing the price to decrease.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, when the demand for a cryptocurrency surpasses its supply, its price increases and can continue to have an upward momentum until there is a drop in supply or one of the other factors kicks in.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Cost of production</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost of production plays an important part in determining the price of any product or service, and cryptocurrencies are not an exception. But first, let's understand how cryptocurrency coins are produced.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency coins are generated through a process called mining, which is carried out by verifying crypto transactions on the blockchain. The miners' network is essential to creating new crypto coins, maintaining the blockchain, and making decentralised cryptocurrency work. In order to succeed at mining, miners need powerful computers and electricity, which of course, increases their investment cost. Naturally, miners will only invest their efforts and resources to produce cryptocurrencies if the end reward covers their expense and includes a profit.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, for miners to make a profit, the value of cryptocurrencies needs to be high enough, and this is how the cost of production affects their value.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Competition</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cryptocurrency market is quite populated, and many new cryptocurrencies are being introduced every day. This makes the market more competitive. Suppose traders feel a new or upcoming cryptocurrency has potential, their demand might shift, resulting in a drop in demand for the usually popular cryptocurrencies. While popular coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum have secured top positions, their prices could take a hit or rise depending on how other cryptocurrencies perform. Additionally, the prices of the top cryptocurrencies could also affect other cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Market conditions</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In uncertain times or during inflation, traders tend to turn to safe-haven assets such as gold, US dollar, or Japanese yen; generally preferring to avoid risky investments. If this happens, traders, in particular, might prefer to sell or avoid investing in cryptocurrencies, which is known to be a volatile and risky market. Needless to say, the drop in demand could result in a price fluctuation.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crypto-specific factors</span></h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Availability on exchanges</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency exchange is a place where you can exchange your cryptocurrencies for other digital currencies or fiat money. Availability on exchanges determines how much a particular cryptocurrency is bought or sold, thereby influencing its price movements.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular cryptocurrencies are available at many exchanges, while smaller coins may be available only at a few exchanges. In this case, if traders want to swap a popular cryptocurrency for a cryptocurrency that&rsquo;s not widely available, they will need to carry out multiple exchanges and pay a fee each time they swap.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a trader wants to exchange Avalanche for Polkadot, but cannot find an exchange with both cryptocurrencies. He will have to convert Avalanche to USD at one exchange and pay a fee. Then he will have to convert the USD to Polkadot at another exchange and pay a fee. Naturally, this doubles the trader&rsquo;s investment cost and could discourage his demand, which might affect the price later on.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Speculation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regulations</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cryptocurrency market is both unregulated and decentralised. Since it has gained popularity, governments across the globe have discussed ways to </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/the-weekly-market-report-21-02-2022-27-02-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regulate it </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or tax the money people use to cash it out. Any announcement from government bodies is likely to affect the demand and investment, finally resulting in a fluctuation of cryptocurrency prices.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></h3>\n<p>Social media and digital forums have also come to influence cryptocurrency price movements significantly. Along with providing information on blockchain updates, social media has also become the go-to for opinions of cryptocurrency influencers. Since it has a way of directing general public opinion, it also influences the way traders feel about the current market situation and their buying or selling decisions, which affects demand. In this case, too, a drop or spike in demand influences cryptocurrency prices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although cryptocurrency prices are likely to fluctuate, there are some factors that allow you to make educated decisions before you place a crypto trade. However, none of these factors can give you a guaranteed prediction of a price movement. A safer way to develop a crypto trading strategy is to test and try different options and see which one is working for you. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are interested in developing your crypto trading skills, practice with a </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demo account's</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> virtual funds </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and keep these factors in mind before you trade with real money.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>","published_date":"2022-04-28"},{"id":"112074cf-de29-492b-8f48-ad6c94de3086","main_image":{"id":"c2ff2957-912f-4d0f-ad7b-06b6af55b117","description":"Try out the different payment methods available on Deriv.","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/cac11/Various%20payment%20methods.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/89239/Various%20payment%20methods.jpg 150w,\n/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/2c227/Various%20payment%20methods.jpg 300w,\n/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/cac11/Various%20payment%20methods.jpg 600w,\n/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/751a4/Various%20payment%20methods.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/49f80/Various%20payment%20methods.webp 150w,\n/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/de298/Various%20payment%20methods.webp 300w,\n/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/52493/Various%20payment%20methods.webp 600w,\n/static/a362218b7566c4fc6398b54af151bb68/1eb60/Various%20payment%20methods.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"various-payment-methods-on-deriv","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_eu_uk","tags":[{"id":"223","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Payment methods"}}],"blog_title":"Various payment methods on Deriv","blog_description":"Wondering how to deposit and withdraw money when trading with us?

Whether you can use credit, debit or both types of cards is usually determined by your location and the card provider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, we accept both credit and debit cards for deposits and withdrawals. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a full list of accepted cards:<br /></span></p>\n<p><a title=\"The different credit and debit cards available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bc60390e-787b-4a47-b6a8-f29f6bb3f3e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bc60390e-787b-4a47-b6a8-f29f6bb3f3e5\" alt=\"The different credit and debit cards available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that as the cardholder, you should be aware of the terms and conditions set by your bank.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>E-wallets</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-wallets represent a closed ecosystem, where funds circulate only between users and integrated merchants. This makes transactions much quicker, offering an overall smoother experience.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most e-wallets are used for international transactions as they have a global or at least continental reach. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like credit and debit cards, each e-wallet has its unique authentication process. Among the most popular e-wallets are Skrill, Neteller, and PerfectMoney.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is the complete list of e-wallets available on Deriv:<br /></span></p>\n<p><a title=\"The list of e-wallets available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3a46d9ea-a6be-4ed3-a348-942676bab61a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2caf4ffb-9894-40a9-9445-36a18bcc4c08\" alt=\"The list of e-wallets available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></p>\n<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<p>Besides fiat money, we also offer popular cryptocurrencies as payment methods on our platforms &ndash; Bitcoin (BTC), LiteCoin (LTC), Ether (ETH), USDT (Tether Omni Layer and Tether Erc-20), and USD Coin (USDC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a title=\"The different types of cryptocurrency methods available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/edd3f31f-8179-40c7-ae24-fc4a6510763e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/edd3f31f-8179-40c7-ae24-fc4a6510763e\" alt=\"The different types of cryptocurrency methods available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can transfer any of these digital coins from your cryptocurrency wallets directly to your Deriv account.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Fiat onramp</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don&rsquo;t own any cryptocurrency but would like to begin trading with it, we have a payment solution for you too. Our fiat onramp services allow you to purchase cryptocurrencies with physical money, also known as fiat money, and receive them directly into your Deriv trading account.<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are the fiat onramp methods available on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p><a title=\"The different types of fiat onramp methods available on Deriv.\" href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fcc78560-b1d3-48fd-aa27-0fd6b893da7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fcc78560-b1d3-48fd-aa27-0fd6b893da7d\" alt=\"The different types of fiat onramp methods available on Deriv.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"336\" /></span></a></p>\n<h3>Additional payment methods (APMs)&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Additional payment methods, or APMs, are payment methods that do not require cards of any kind. These payment methods are perfect for clients who prefer the traditional modes as APMs include prevalent local payment methods such as vouchers and cash settlements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Some popular APMs on Deriv are the following:&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Vouchers and disbursements&nbsp;</h4>\n<p>These are prepaid payment methods widespread in African countries. With these, you can choose how much money to send merchants and the duration these vouchers and disbursements are to be active.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Cash settlements</h4>\n<p>This is a popular payment method in Latin American countries, in the form of an invoice issued by a bank that allows you to pay the exact amount you owe. As long as the settlement is paid within the due date on the invoice, you can pay it anywhere it is accepted.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>Payment Agents</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment agents are independent exchangers on Deriv, ranging from currency exchangers, affiliates and community managers. These agents interact with traders who want to make deposits and withdrawals through local bank wires and e-payment methods.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Payment agents can determine their commission per transaction (subject to our established thresholds), choose which countries to service, and how to promote their services.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Deriv P2P</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv P2P is our peer-to-peer deposit and withdrawal service that lets you move funds in and out of your Deriv account. With this app, you can connect with your fellow traders, exchange USD in your local currency, and get your deposits and withdrawals done within minutes.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv P2P is also very convenient, as you can exchange funds anytime, and you get to choose your exchange rates. The best part? It is available as web and mobile apps, so you can easily make your transactions on any of your devices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have learned about the various payment methods on our platforms, head to the Cashier, choose your preferred payment method, and make a deposit to start trading now.&nbsp;</span></p>","published_date":"2022-04-28"},{"id":"08ebb4ff-709d-413b-b513-0b498668625d","main_image":{"id":"a22ba63d-7793-42eb-bf25-30de75409e91","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/89239/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.jpg 150w,\n/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/2c227/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.jpg 300w,\n/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/cac11/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.jpg 600w,\n/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/751a4/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/49f80/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.webp 150w,\n/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/de298/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.webp 300w,\n/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/52493/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.webp 600w,\n/static/e548d46098706f72108742a892e93b92/1eb60/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2025%20Apr%202022.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-25-04-2022-01-05-2022","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"265","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 25 Apr 2022","blog_description":"In the last week of April, markets experienced a bit of a stir but none as much as gold, which saw a complete trend switch.

Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After reaching a high of $1.0936 on Thursday, 21 April 2022, the EUR/USD pair bounced for the second week in a row from around $1.0761 to settle near $1.08 for the week. On the week's final trading day, risk concerns overshadowed positive macroeconomic developments, bringing the greenback back into favour.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initial spike in the pair&rsquo;s price was caused by an unexpected hawkish shift from some European policymakers. Luis de Guindos, Vice President of the European Central Bank said the inflation is close to a peak but a rate hike in the 2nd half of the year is feasible, depending on macroeconomic data.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders continued to desire safety amid concerns about a US recession and the Eastern European crisis, so the enthusiasm was short-lived. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note in the United States was under 3% this week. Additionally, inflation in the United States reached a four-decade high, touching 8.5% YoY in March. While in the European Union, inflation was verified at 7.4%, also a multi-decade record, but slightly lower than previously predicted. Here, inflationary expectations are stronger than macroeconomic indicators of easing price pressures.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hawkishness among central bankers has become the new norm. Except for the Bank of Japan, virtually every central bank plans a more aggressive monetary policy tightening, which does not seem sufficient to contain the situation. Such a scenario creates an ideal ground for a US dollar rise, which will continue in the weeks ahead since none of the market's bearish reasons are expected to fade anytime soon. High-yielding equities are also expected to fall, while US markets are expected to fare better since the US Federal Reserve has been laying the groundwork for an aggressive rate hike for a while, the majority of which has already been priced in.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's still unclear whether the European Central Bank (ECB) will act in July (as expected this week) or opt for a 25-bps or 50-bps hike, leading to the possibility of a short-term strengthening of the common currency.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the technicals, the hourly chart for the week seemed to be skewed to the right for the reasons mentioned above and is currently just above the 5 and 10 SMA's at around $1.0789 and $1.0796, respectively. Also, EUR/USD was trading at its psychological level of around $1.0810 when it broke through the level on Wednesday, 20 April 2022 and traded at its highest level on Thursday, 21 April 2022. However, it fell below its psychological level towards the end of the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD was down, ending the week at around the $1.2839 level and making the previous week's rally appear to be a one-off in an ongoing trend. GBP bulls sought to regain the $1.31 level in the second half of the week, but the US dollar remained dominant. In the coming week, the pair will brace itself for critical US economic releases. However, the UK data releases appear to be relatively quiet.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up in your trading strategy with the latest market information and trade CFDs on the </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f5a50289-ad35-4d76-9f09-58514738a9fe?width=1699&amp;height=877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f5a50289-ad35-4d76-9f09-58514738a9fe?width=1699&amp;height=877\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold saw a change in the overall trend for the first time since the beginning of April. The trading conditions on Easter Monday gave way to a strong upward movement. As you can see in the chart above, the yellow metal started the week on a bullish note, reaching close to $2,000, its highest in over a month. Later, gold prices bounced around the psychological level of $1,980 before breaking free into a downward trend. The bullion saw a heavy decline on Tuesday, 19 April 2022, owing to dominating risk flows in the global financial markets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst the treasury yields and the greenback were lifted due to faster policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, the precious metal ended the week close to $1,930. Gold saw its biggest weekly decline since mid-March, having dropped below its SMA 5 and SMA 10, which now act as resistances. Overall, gold showed a similar decline against the US dollar and the Euro, having dropped by around 2.4% during the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The safe-haven asset is highly susceptible to the rising US short-term interest rates and higher yields, which increases the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. However, it is a safe place to park your funds during rising political and economic tensions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though gold has come off its recent highs, inflation and geopolitical concerns continue to have a buoyant effect on gold prices. It&rsquo;s only safe to say that gold should hold above the $1,900 level till there is a significant change in the Russia-Ukraine dispute.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil followed gold&rsquo;s footsteps and added to its losses from last week. On Monday, 18 April 2022, oil prices dropped to nearly a two-week low due to the growing concerns over reduced fuel demand owing to the prolonged COVID-19 lockdowns in Shanghai. Overall, oil prices fell by nearly 4% last week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, crude oil prices are around $20 lower than last month&rsquo;s peak. President Biden recently tapped into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and reopened oil leases on public land. However, this development has not impacted the asset and fuel prices remain high.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the Ukraine crisis deepens, oil prices are not expected to drop below the $90-a-barrel mark as the European Union weighs a ban on Russian oil. If that were to happen, the even shorter supply would catapult oil prices in the opposite direct.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the most of these market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d919a8a8-c58f-4fa7-acc7-8262a3aeb1ca?width=1696&amp;height=873\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d919a8a8-c58f-4fa7-acc7-8262a3aeb1ca?width=1696&amp;height=873\" alt=\"BTC/USD chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Powell's speech from the previous night weighed on US markets and echoed on the cryptocurrency market, leaving an emerging breakaway from a critical support line. This movement is evident on the chart, where we see a dip in BTC/USD that dropped below the $39,500 mark after it reached its high for the week, which was above the $42,500 mark. Bitcoin then stayed along the lines for the rest of the week. Based on the hourly chart for the week, BTC/USD was at around $39,508, below the 5 and 10 SMA at around $39,564 and $39,603, respectively, which are currently acting as the resistance levels.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Ethereum was down by over 2.4%, while other leading altcoins in the top 10 were down by 0.4% (Terra) and 4.7% (Polkadot).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The total cryptocurrency market capitalisation, according to CoinMarketCap, fell overnight by 2.2% to $1.88 trillion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, on Friday, 22 April 2022, Twitter Inc. announced that it is working with digital payment processor Stripe Inc. on a trial program for cryptocurrency payouts for its monetisation products.

The Dow fell by 1.9% for the week, the S&amp;P 500 fell by 2.8%, and the Nasdaq declined by 3.8%. Moreover, Goldman Sachs, Home Depot and Visa were big downside contributors.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to reacting to the weaker-than-expected earnings reports, traders' sentiment was influenced by the Federal Reserve's tightening policy. Fed Reserve Chair Jerome Powell outlined his most aggressive approach to taming inflation and highlighted that a 50 basis point hike is on the table for May.

Find out what API is, how it works, and how you can use it.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We use an API on a daily basis without even realising it. For example, every time you click the 'Continue with Facebook' button to log in to an app, API gets involved. A weather app on your phone works with the help of API as well. And even online shops work via API. So how does it work?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we'll explain what an API is, how it works, and how you can use </span><a href=\"https://api.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv API</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your benefit.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is an API</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API stands for application programming interface. It may sound a little complicated for non-technical people, but it simply refers to a way of communication designed specifically for computers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A good example of an API in action would be a flight aggregator like Skyscanner &ndash; a website that displays flights and airlines available on dates you select. This website communicates with numerous airline websites and retrieves data from them, such as flight times and prices, using an API.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, an API is mostly used by trading apps and platforms to fetch data like live quotes and trading conditions from the brokers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv API does exactly the same &ndash; provides access to Deriv's trading conditions and assets available for trading to third-party software, like your trading app or platform.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How an API works</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to human communication, programming communication requires an exchange of information between two sides &mdash; a requestor and a respondent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our earlier example, the aggregator website acts as a requester, asking for flight data, while the airlines' websites act as the respondents that provide the requested information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">API users commonly refer to the requesting side as a client and the responding side as a server. An API is no more than software that enables a client and a server to communicate with each other by sending requests and responses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each request and response is called an API call and can be written in different programming languages, depending on the requirements of the server &ndash; Java or Python.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What you can do with Deriv API</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Deriv API, you have the freedom to personalise your trading experience. Just build your own trading app or platform, add the features you like, and connect it to the Deriv server via our API. The API will transmit data from our server to your app, enabling you to trade just the way you want.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, besides adding a unique personal touch to your trading journey, you can take your API activities even further and monetise them.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How you can earn with Deriv API</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the 3 opportunities to earn with Deriv API:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build your app, sign up as a </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/partners/affiliate-ib/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv affiliate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and get commissions on trades completed via your app and the affiliate plan you select.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://api.deriv.com/docs/app-registration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Register your trading app or platform with Deriv</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, add a markup to the contract prices, and profit from every purchased contract.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign up as a </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/partners/payment-agent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payment agent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, build your custom website to process payments for Deriv&rsquo;s clients, and earn commission on every transaction completed via your website.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9cb0d64e-fe03-4bc4-8990-bb8a600c0498\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9cb0d64e-fe03-4bc4-8990-bb8a600c0498\" alt=\"How to Earn with Deriv API\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Undoubtedly, creating an app or a website requires a set of skills that not everyone may have, such as knowing programming languages and having coding experience.

Plus, both require relatively little capital to open a trade. However, though very similar to each other, these derivatives differ in how they work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we'll be explaining the differences between <a href=\"https://deriv.com/trade-types/cfds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFD trading</a> vs <a href=\"https://deriv.com/trade-types/options/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">options trading</a> on Deriv and the advantages of trading them.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4 key differences between CFD trading and options trading on Deriv</span></h2>\n<h3>1. The trade</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading allows traders to trade on the difference between the opening and closing price of an asset. To put it simply, you speculate on the direction of the market &mdash; whether the asset's price will rise or fall. Your potential gain or loss is determined by the price difference of the underlying asset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options allow traders to trade on the future value of an asset. If you anticipate that an asset's price will rise, you place a call option to purchase it at a lower price than its market value. If you think the price will fall, you place a put option to sell the asset at a higher price than its market value. You can exercise either of these options at any time while your trade is running.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you better understand how call and put options work, have a read of our \"What is options trading\" blog.</span></p>\n<h3>2. Leverage</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs are traded with leverage. Leverage allows you to open larger positions for a fraction of the contract&rsquo;s value. It increases your market exposure and can amplify your potential gains and losses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an options trade, you only place your stake. If the market moves against your prediction, your loss is limited to your stake.</span></p>\n<h3>3. Trade duration</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs do not expire. A trade can continue running as long as you have sufficient funds to maintain the required margin level. Your margin is the amount of capital you must have in your account to keep your trade open.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, trade on options runs on a set timeframe that you set yourself. For example, 3 ticks, 40 minutes, 5 days, or more.</span></p>\n<h3>4. Trade outcome</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a CFD trade, you&rsquo;ll only know your potential gain or loss once you close your trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an options trade, you know the potential payout of your trade beforehand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we've covered the key differences between CFD trading and options trading, let's explore some of the advantages of trading them. So, what are they?</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two advantages of trading CFDs on Deriv</span></h2>\n<h3><strong>Negative balance protection</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When trading CFDs, you get to enjoy negative balance protection which simply means you cannot lose more than the amount in your account. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your trade reaches the stop out level (which is set at a specified percentage), it will be closed. If your balance reaches negative, the negative balance protection kicks in, and it will be automatically reset to zero.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stop out level refers to the point at which your trading account has insufficient funds to sustain open positions. When this occurs, your open positions carrying the biggest losses are closed automatically due to the decrease in margin level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The margin level is the percentage of your balance and profit with margin added together. It indicates how much funds you have available to open new trades or maintain the old ones. </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please note that the negative balance protection doesn&rsquo;t apply to the Deriv MT5 Financial account.</span></em></p>\n<h3><strong>Risk management</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading CFDs on assets with high volatility comes with risks. One of the main advantages of trading it on Deriv is the risk management features available, such as stop loss and take profit. Using these features, you can handle high volatility trades more effectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take profit allows you to close your trade automatically as soon as it reaches the profit level you&rsquo;ve set. With this feature, you decide on a specific profit to close your position in advance if the market shifts and goes against your prediction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop loss works similarly, except it limits your potential losses. When the asset price reaches the stop loss level you've set, your trade automatically closes.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two advantages of trading options on Deriv</span></h2>\n<h3><strong>Limited risk</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In options trading, your risk is limited to your stake amount. If the market moves against your prediction, you&rsquo;ll never lose more than your stake.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>More choices</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With options, there's an array of choices available since it offers a greater range of contract alternatives. You can choose from 3 options contracts &mdash; digital options, lookbacks, and call/put spreads. These contracts have different conditions, allowing you to create positions you feel will be advantageous to you.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which trade type is better suited to you?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading offers the opportunity to spread your capital across a wide range of assets, allowing you to diversify your portfolio. If you prefer low margin requirements, no fees, as well as no day-trading restrictions, this trade type is for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading offers different strategies giving you more ways to navigate around risks. The flexibility it offers lets you recreate other positions, allowing you to generate higher potential returns from your trades. If you want to explore more ways to trade better, then this is the trade type for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore CFD and options more, we&rsquo;ve covered these trade types extensively in our &ldquo;<a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What is CFD trading?</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;Options trading on Deriv&rdquo; blog posts.

The key bearish catalyst was that the European Central Bank announced President Christine Lagarde would make no adjustments to their monetary policy. On the other hand, US Federal Reserve officials continue to expect a 50 bps hike in May 2022, paving the way for a balance-sheet reduction. As a result, the imbalance between the two central banks will almost certainly continue to weigh on the EUR/USD.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD recovered earlier in the week after falling to its lowest level since November 2020 &ndash; $1.2974.

According to the report's additional details, the Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased from 6.4% to 6.5% in the same period, compared to the market expectation of 6.6%. Although the initial market reaction to the US inflation report weakened the US dollar, hawkish Fed commentary triggered a rally in US T-bond yields late on Tuesday, 12 April 2022.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas in the UK, the annual CPI rose from 6.2% in February to 7% in March, exceeding analysts' expectations of 6.7%. Despite the hot UK inflation data, GBP/USD struggled to gain traction until the US dollar came under heavy selling pressure amid falling US yields during the US trading hours on Wednesday, 13 April 2022.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD extended its recovery to a new nine-day high of $1.3150 in the early European session on Thursday, 14 April 2022, after rising more than 100 pips on Wednesday, 13 April 2022. However, with the European Central Bank (ECB) maintaining its policy settings, the greenback regained its strength, forcing the GBP/USD to fall.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the hourly chart for the week seen above, GBP/USD had been moving around $1.300 (the psychological mark). However, due to heavy selling of the US dollar on Wednesday, 13 April 2022, the pair picked up and stayed alongside but could not sustain itself further. As of Thursday, 14 April 2022, the pair ended at around $1.3071 above the 50% retracement level near the $1.306 mark. If the pair continues to find its momentum, its next resistance level would be at a 61.8% retracement level, approximately at $1.3081. But if the pair spirals down, then the next support level would be at the 38.2% retracement level near $1.304.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD/JPY reached a high of ￥126.32 in Friday's holiday-shortened market, capping a 0.41% (close over close) gain for the week. Inflation-boosted US Treasury yields, combined with the risks of a stalled but still dangerous Ukraine war and the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) seemingly permanent liquidity policy, have created a near-ideal environment for the greenback against the yen.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, there will be no high-level data releases. However, the focus will be on the Bank of England (BoE) and the Federal Reserve. The BoE has a more difficult balancing act than the US Federal Reserve in terms of policy tightening. Both central banks are battling inflation, but the BoE is growing increasingly anxious about the growth outlook in the context of a protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/ec8b301d-fe29-42c2-9dac-c400e54b0cea?width=1695&amp;height=871\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/ec8b301d-fe29-42c2-9dac-c400e54b0cea?width=1695&amp;height=871\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Due to the Ukraine crisis and mounting inflation, traders preferred the precious metal to park their funds on the long Easter weekend.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold's prices rallied for 6 days in a row until the yellow metal eased off on Thursday, 14 April 2022. The momentum came after the US dollar strengthened and yields rose as traders geared up for US interest rate hikes. However, the bullion kept on track for its weekly gain and ended the trading week above the $1,970 level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the hourly chart, gold started the week at around $1,948 and ended at around the $1,974 mark. We see an upward trend for the week, with the price ending just above the 5-day moving average at around $1,792. Even though we see a few spikes on the downside, gold maintained enough traction to post gains for the week.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold still maintains a strong and strengthening demand as a hedge against inflation despite the expectation that the Fed will continue to raise rates aggressively to combat detrimental price pressures through the end of 2022 and beyond.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the oil market, prices rose by approximately 10%, with the instrument closing the week at the $106 level as traders weighed news of a possible European ban on Russian oil imports.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, on Thursday, 14 April 2022, the trading conditions for the global oil markets were fairly thin ahead of the long weekend in the major North American and European markets due to the tightening global supply. Last week, the EU took its first steps in response to the war on Ukraine by banning Russian energy imports and agreed to stop coal imports completely, starting later this year.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent news from IEA members on the release of 240M barrels of crude oil reserves over the next 6 months has dampened expectations for a return to last month's $120 levels. Additionally, if the US and Iran reach an agreement on easing sanctions, more than 1M barrels per day in Iranian supply may return to the market.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the upcoming months, market conditions are expected to remain tight as global oil markets adjust to significant disruptions in Russian exports due to sanctions over the country's invasion of Ukraine.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the most of these market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/058aa506-0763-452a-82d0-d4e302268bad?width=1708&amp;height=871\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/058aa506-0763-452a-82d0-d4e302268bad?width=1708&amp;height=871\" alt=\"BTC chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

If it breaks through that level, its primary resistance will shift to $41,007.73 at the 50% retracement level. While Bitcoin saw some volatility during the first half of the week, it traded sideways for the latter part. However, Bitcoin has stuck to its overall decline since the beginning of April.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altcoins such as Ethereum, Binance coin and Dash have replicated Bitcoin&rsquo;s trend, having hit a peak midweek and declining ever since, to finish the week slightly higher than they started on Monday, 11 April 2022. Ethereum, Binance coin and Dash experienced nearly a 0.3%, 3.6% and 4.2% increase, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doge experienced the &lsquo;Musk-effect&rsquo; when Elon Musk, the newly established largest shareholder of Twitter, urged Doge as one of the payment options for Twitter Blue, resulting in an 8% increase midweek.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency, in general, has been on the decline since the start of the month. However, trader sentiment is that a reversal in the trend is imminent.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency has been a hot topic during the previous week and leaders of major cryptocurrency companies have expressed that regulators have started to look at digital currencies positively. For instance, the UK government announced that it would introduce stablecoins to track existing currencies' prices. Additionally, the US President signed an executive order advocating the coordination across governments for digital assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other crypto-related news, the Wikipedia community, on Tuesday, 12 April 2022, voted against all cryptocurrency donations to the platform, owing to its environmental impact. Also, in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, 14 April 2022, the Amazon CEO said that the e-commerce giant does not have plans to add cryptocurrency as a payment option soon.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,451.23</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">143.15</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.42%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13,893.21</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-97.00</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.69%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,392.59</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-19.94</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.45%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a short trading week with the markets closed for Good Friday.

Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 closed at 4,394, ending the week down by 0.45%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 declined by 0.7% to finish around 13,893 for the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stocks retreated as fresh inflation data took hold of traders&rsquo; thoughts last week. On Tuesday, 12 April 2022, the March Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed an 8.5% increase for the month.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supplier prices have also risen above expectations. The Purchasing Price Index (PPI), which measures prices paid by wholesale suppliers, gained 11.2% from a year ago, marking its hottest yearly increase since November 2010. Meanwhile, Jobless Claims rose to 185,000 for the week ending on 9 April 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As traders assessed rising inflationary pressures last week, treasury yields climbed to multi-year highs.

Unlike </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technical analysis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which evaluates past price movements, fundamental analysis focuses on current and upcoming economic and political events that affect price movements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main purpose of fundamental analysis is to determine whether the current market price of an asset reflects its real value. The discrepancies between the two numbers provide buy and sell signals:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a market price is higher than the estimated real value, traders anticipate a price drop and sell an asset.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a market price is lower than the estimated real value, traders anticipate a price spike and buy an asset.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does fundamental analysis determine the real value of an asset?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The asset's real value also referred to as true or intrinsic value, can be influenced by many factors, both local (microeconomic) and international (macroeconomic). Fundamental analysis takes into account all these factors and combines the findings to predict market price movements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microeconomic analysis studies factors that affect the performance of businesses and companies. Macroeconomic analysis, by contrast, examines broader factors that affect the national, regional, or international economy as a whole.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, each market has its own set of market-specific factors to evaluate.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does fundamental analysis evaluate each financial market?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis is especially popular among stock traders because publicly traded companies have a lot of information easily accessible to anyone, making market evaluation much easier. However, you can also perform fundamental analysis on all the other financial markets using data from different sources.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis of stocks</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most important documents to study when evaluating individual stocks is a company&rsquo;s balance sheet &ndash; a summary of the company&rsquo;s financial activities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other 2 important documents that can supplement the balance sheet analysis are the income and cash flow statements.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a company is studied internally, it's important to compare it with its competitors and evaluate the entire industry's health and the country's economy. This will give you a complete overview of the stock&rsquo;s real value.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis of stock indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a stock index represents a collection of individual stocks, the first step in analysing an index is to evaluate each stock individually. Once you have an overview of each stock, the next step is to compare it with a whole index.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will give you a chance to identify the top-performing stocks you need to pay close attention to and the stocks that don&rsquo;t play a significant role in the index.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last step is to evaluate the industry or the country&rsquo;s economic situation, depending on the index you analyse.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis of forex</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fundamental analysis of forex pairs measures the strength of a currency, so the main data to analyse is the country&rsquo;s economic state. Numbers such as GDP (gross domestic product), inflation, and the central bank's interest rate are important indicators of the economy's health.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, it&rsquo;s crucial to keep abreast of political and social events that may influence the currency&rsquo;s price movement. For example, Brexit caused a significant fall of the GBP, and mass demonstrations in the US in May-June 2021 resulted in the drop of the USD&rsquo;s value.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis of commodities</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the commodity market is primarily made of natural resources, its prices are driven by physical supply and demand. This means the price movements are influenced not only by political and economic events but also by natural disasters.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, droughts and floods have a significant effect on agricultural resources, causing shortages and decreasing supply, which leads to increasing prices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main sources of information about the supply and demand of commodity assets is the Commitments of Traders (COT) report, published by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This report provides weekly updates on the state of the commodity market, offering a valuable indication of the upcoming price movements.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis of cryptocurrencies</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the cryptocurrency market is still very new, performing its fundamental analysis with the same tools as other financial markets is quite challenging. For example, you can't find out the real value of Bitcoin by analysing a balance sheet of a company that issues it because it is decentralised, and there is no such company.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are still some indicators that can forecast an upcoming price change of cryptocurrencies. Government regulations and news have the most significant effect on its pricing. Every time a country officially legalises or bans cryptocurrencies, their prices tend to swing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other factors to pay attention to, are market capitalisation, the number of transactions, and how widely a particular cryptocurrency is accepted.

Get started now! Find out the forex assets to trade and the different trading platforms you can use on Deriv.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex (or foreign exchange) market is where you can trade global currencies. It&rsquo;s the world's largest and most liquid financial market, with daily transactions totaling over 6 trillion US dollars.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high liquidity and volatile nature of the market allow traders to easily buy and sell currencies, providing them more short-term trading opportunities and greater potential gains.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade forex by predicting an asset&rsquo;s price movement without actually buying or owning the underlying asset (currency). This will be explained further in the latter part of this blog. First, let's go over the currency pairs available to trade on our trading platforms.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex assets to trade</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, the forex assets available for you to trade are currency pairs and basket indices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In forex trading, currencies are traded in pairs. The first currency is called base, and the second one is called quote. In the GBP/USD pair, for example, the British pound sterling is the base currency, while the US dollar is the quote currency. The price of this pair represents how much one British pound sterling is worth in USD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currency pairs are divided into 3 groups &mdash; <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">major, minor, and exotic pairs</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Major pairs are the most actively traded in high volume (e.g. GBP/USD, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CHF). Minor pairs are less popular and not as liquid as major pairs (e.g. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EUR/CHF, CAD/JPY, and GBP/AUD), while </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exotic pairs</span><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are a major currency paired with a currency of an emerging economy (e.g. GBP/TRY, NZD/SGD, and EUR/ZAR).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to these currency pairs, you can also trade forex basket indices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basket indices are weighted indices that measure the value of one currency against a basket of major currencies (each currency in the basket is weighted by 20%). On Deriv, these indices include the Australian dollar basket, Euro basket, British pound sterling basket, and US dollar basket.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AUD Basket measures the Australian dollar&rsquo;s value against a basket of 5 global currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUR Basket measures the Euro's value against a basket of 5 global currencies (USD, AUD, GBP, JPY, CAD).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP Basket measures the British pound&rsquo;s against a basket of 5 global currencies (USD, EUR, AUD, JPY, CAD).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD Basket measures the US dollars&rsquo; value against a basket of 5 global currencies (EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s now go through the trade types that apply to forex.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract types</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can trade forex on Deriv with 3 different trade types (also referred to as contract types) &mdash; CFDs, multipliers, and options. These trading contracts do not require you to actually own or buy the currencies that you want to trade, they allow you to enter into a contract that predicts which way you think the market will move.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to trade forex with CFDs</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFD</a> stands for contract for difference. Essentially, it is an agreement between a broker and a trader to exchange the difference between the open and close price of an asset.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think the price of an asset will go up, you can buy a CFD and benefit from that rise. If you think that its price will go down, you can sell a CFD and profit from that fall. The potential profit only applies when the market moves in favour of your prediction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can trade forex with CFDs on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X. Check out our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a> on CFDs for more information.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv MT5 is a popular multi-asset CFD trading platform packed with innovative features as well as superior technical and fundamental analysis tools. <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=introducing-deriv-x-%E2%80%93-the-highly-customisable-cfd-trading-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv X</a> is another superb platform that lets you customise your trading experience with drag-and-drop widgets and intuitive tools. Both platforms offer <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-leverage-in-online-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high leverage</a> and low spreads.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to trade forex with multipliers</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multipliers allow you to amplify your potential profits without increasing your potential losses.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also further limit your risk with multipliers. Its stop out function ensures that you will not lose more than your initial stake. Additionally, multipliers have <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risk management features</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that let you better manage your trade: stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/deriv-multipliers-how-they-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers trading</a> is available on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader and Deriv GO</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader offers you flexibility with stakes as low as $0.50, and the Deriv GO mobile app lets you enjoy a smooth trading experience wherever you go.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to trade forex with options</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/trade-types/options/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Options</a> let you potentially earn a payout from predicting market movements within a specific time period. On Deriv, you can trade forex with 3 different types of options contracts: digital options, lookbacks, and call/put spreads.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trade type is available on DBot, DTrader, and SmartTrader.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DBot allows you to build a trading bot and automate your trades without coding skills, while SmartTrader is yet another user-friendly platform that gives you access to your favourite markets.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give forex trading a go with a free <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demo account</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">after you sign up on Deriv.

Click to see full size&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar index advanced to $100 for the first time in nearly 2 years, reaching as high as $100.19 &ndash; its best level since May 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main driver of the USD&rsquo;s strength was Fed hawkishness. The Federal Reserve March meeting minutes on Wednesday, 6 April 2022, resulted in an interest rate hike of 25-bps. However, the minutes showed strong support for getting rates back up quickly, supporting market expectations that the Fed will lift rates in 50-bps intervals at upcoming meetings.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the trading week, the Euro dropped significantly, reaching the $1.0850 level. The main reason for this fall was the interest rate differences between the bond markets of the European Union and the United States, which continue to put downward pressure on the Euro.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the pair continues to be one that cannot find a reason to go up, and beyond the interest rate difference, there are a lot of other reasons to think that the Euro is going to struggle. The European Union is almost certainly going to go into a recession, as the energy issues alone are going to cause problems. Moreover, Germany reduced their economic growth forecast for 2022 from 4.6% to 1.8%, due to geopolitical risks in France with the French presidential election, and the war in Ukraine.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the ECB President will face a particularly challenging meeting next week as she aims to strike a balance between dampening inflation while supporting a weak growth outlook. This comes at a time when other major central banks are already tightening monetary policies and are prepared to hike interest rates in ever-increasing increments.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As shown in the chart as well, EUR/USD had a downward trend for the week touching its lowest point on Friday, 8 April 2022, below the $1.085 mark. However, the pair showed a small upward movement and is currently at around $1.0877 just near its 5-day moving average.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the early session on Friday, 8 April 2022, GBP/USD hit its lowest level since November 2020 at $1.29820, due to the strengthening of the US dollar. However, the currency pair did rebound to the $1.3030 level by the end of the trading day, posting a weekly loss of about 0.6%. The price movement this week was not heavily influenced by UK factors. This is because the upside of GBP is currently being limited by expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will turn more dovish in its next meeting. In the coming week, GBP/USD traders will be focused on the results of the UK Consumer Price Index, US Consumer Price Index and US Producer Price Index, which are to be published this Tuesday and Wednesday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD/JPY ended last week in the green at &yen;124.34. Strong US data and the Japanese government bond&rsquo;s limited upside to defend its 0.25% yield target helped the pair rise. It will be interesting to see how the incoming geopolitical headlines drive risk sentiment and demand for the safe-haven JPY.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3d52d738-3d6e-425a-a619-56afe20b9429?width=1685&amp;height=863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3d52d738-3d6e-425a-a619-56afe20b9429?width=1685&amp;height=863\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For most of the week, gold against the US dollar was unable to make a decisive move in either direction. Despite broad-based dollar strength and a sharp increase in US Treasury bond yields, gold managed to hold its ground on safe-haven flows, closing in the upper half of its weekly range above $1,940.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, gold against the Euro rose by nearly 1.65% this week (based on the difference between Monday&rsquo;s close and Friday&rsquo;s close), indicating that the metal was able to capture some of the capital flowing out of the Euro as well.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the hourly chart for the week above, gold against the US dollar rose in the first 2 days of the week and surpassed the $1,940 mark only to fall towards the end of the second day, below the $1,925 mark and stay around it. As days passed by, we noticed an upward trend for the same and it ended the week at around the $1,947 mark which is above the 5-day moving average of $1,944 that is acting as the current support level for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Tuesday, April 12, 2022. CPI is expected to rise to a new multi-decade high of 8.3% in March, up from 7.9% in February. A stronger-than-expected CPI could increase the likelihood of 2 consecutive 50-basis-point Fed rate hikes, pushing US T-bond yields even higher, and vice versa. On Thursday, April 14, 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) will announce its monetary policy decisions. The bank is widely expected to maintain its current policy settings, but a hawkish shift in forward guidance could pave the way for a decisive recovery in EUR/USD and weigh on the US dollar. In that case, the XAU/USD pair should be able to rise. On the other hand, the bank could become more cautious, focusing on the potential negative impact of a protracted Russia-Ukraine conflict on economic activity rather than inflation. In such a case, the EUR/USD could face bearish pressure, making it difficult for gold against the US dollar to gain traction.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil, on the other hand, fell for the second week in a row as a result of multiple countries announcing their strategic reserve releases. Another reason for oil&rsquo;s uncertain position is the European allies who rely heavily on Russian oil and are still unsure of how or whether to sanction the Kremlin. Furthermore, the expansion of COVID lockdowns in China, particularly in Shanghai, has also contributed to the bearish trend. However, it remains to be seen how long it will take for disruption fears to resurface.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fffa46e5-06fc-449e-ba3e-2a49176a4890?width=1685&amp;height=863\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fffa46e5-06fc-449e-ba3e-2a49176a4890?width=1685&amp;height=863\" alt=\"BTC Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, cryptocurrencies traded on a downward trend, mirroring the movements of the US equity markets. The price of Bitcoin declined by 8% from Monday through to Friday, reflecting a net change of almost $3,500.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some major altcoins also followed suit, with Ether and Binance coin losing 9.3% and 5.8%, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency was trading close to $42,815 by Friday&rsquo;s close, reverting from previous highs that were above $46,000 earlier in the week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading close to $43,135, slightly below its primary resistance level of $43,316 at the 23.6% retracement level.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst Bitcoin has recovered a portion of its last week&rsquo;s losses, the digital asset is searching for the momentum to clear its initial resistance level. If the crypto can rally, its new primary resistance will move to the $44,012 level.

The Eurostat reported the unemployment rate at 6.8%, which remained in between the mid-market consensus at 6.7% and the prior figure of 6.9%.

Since it was recovering from the previous week's lows, it fell towards the end and closed the week just above its support at 38.2% retracement at the $1.1035 level. If it continues to fall lower, the next support will be at 23.6% retracement at the $1.1005 level.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the absence of a new trigger, GBP/USD continued to trade flat around the $1.3100 level. For now, traders are waiting for Gov. Andrew Bailey's speech to learn more about what the Bank of England will do with its monetary policy in May.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD/JPY recovered after dipping 350-pips in the week, rallying above the &yen;122.00 mark on a buoyant market mood as peace talks between Russia and Ukraine developed further, and US macroeconomic data lifted the US dollar.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, traders eagerly await the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, 6 April 2022, since it will be the first meeting following the interest rate hike in March.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/8c0b14b8-e99e-46bc-8c1b-99d8358a3024?width=1683&amp;height=857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/8c0b14b8-e99e-46bc-8c1b-99d8358a3024?width=1683&amp;height=857\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the start of the week, gold lost a lot of ground due to rising US Treasury bond yields but recovered by the middle of the week. However, with the greenback gaining momentum ahead of the weekend, XAU/USD could not maintain its gains and closed the week with losses.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The release of the US monthly jobs report on Friday, 1 April 2022, reinforced market expectations that the Fed would adopt a more aggressive policy stance to combat persistently high inflation. As a result, the yield on the two-year US government bond, which is highly sensitive to rate hike expectations, reached a three-year high, dragging down the non-yielding yellow metal at the end of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the hourly chart for the week, we see the price fluctuating near the 38.2% &ndash; 61.8% retracement levels at around the $1,920 and $1,934 mark. Gold ended the week at around $1,925, just below the 50% retracement level, which is also acting as the current resistance level. If gold finds an uptrend, its next resistance level would be at the 61.8% retracement level, and if it continues to trend downwards, its next support level would be the 23.6% retracement level at around $1,911.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FOMC minutes this week may impact the market pricing of Fed rate hikes. If policymakers are willing to keep raising the policy rate aggressively in the coming sessions, US Treasury bond yields may continue to rise, putting pressure on gold.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil was down by around -6.30% for the week, extending its losses from Thursday, 31 March 2022, when President Joe Biden authorised the release of 1 million barrels of oil per day from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next 6 months &ndash; the largest release ever.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, members of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which includes the United States, most of Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and South Korea, announced on Friday, 1 April 2022, that they have decided to release oil from their emergency stockpiles to support the United States' decision. The IEA intends to provide more information about the release early this week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the move may keep prices under control in the short term, it should be viewed as only a temporary fix for tight global supplies, especially as the war in Ukraine continues.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2477251f-543c-4ef8-bdca-0056f5668cde?width=1679&amp;height=855\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2477251f-543c-4ef8-bdca-0056f5668cde?width=1679&amp;height=855\" alt=\"BTC chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation surged to a three-month high on Tuesday, 29 March 2022, reaching above $48,000 during a bullish overnight run.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These recovered gains for Bitcoin follow a recent price rally that saw the digital asset rise by more than $10,000 in the previous 2 weeks. Since then, Bitcoin settled from Tuesday's highs to consolidate around the $45,000 mark. As of 18:30 Friday 1 April 2022 UTC, Bitcoin was trading at around $46,390.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the time of writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at around the $46,392 mark. Its primary support level is around $46,194 at the 50% retracement level, followed by its secondary support level of 45,769 at 32.8% retracement. An additional upward price momentum would test Bitcoin's first resistance level of $46,618, and a breach would bring the $47,143 level into account.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is the first time Bitcoin has hit this mark since December 2021 and provides renewed optimism that a longer-term bull market could be forming. Analysts have attributed the cryptocurrency price rally to the bullish trends formulated throughout March, such as the dwindling supply of Bitcoin on crypto exchanges and rumours of other countries following Al Salvador's move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, other altcoins mirrored Bitcoin's gains with Ether, Cardano and Solana&rsquo;s price momentum helping to push the overall crypto market capitalisation above the $2 trillion mark.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$34,818.27</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-137.62</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.39%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$14,861.21</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-126.19</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.84%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$4,545.86</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-29.66</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.65%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, stocks performed modestly as traders assessed a rocky first trading quarter and an unnerving recession indicator from the bond markets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded lower at around $34,818, whilst the S&amp;P 500 dipped by 0.65% to close around $4,545. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite posted a -0.84% loss on the week. On the whole, stocks closed on Friday 1 April 2022 around session highs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite a strong performance in March, Wall Street witnessed its first negative quarter in over 2 years and traders are now assessing what quarter 2 will bring for the markets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most notably, a significant part of the US Treasury yield curve inverted briefly on Friday, 1 April 2022. For the first time since 2019, the spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields varied multiple times last week. This rare phenomenon has come to be known as the prelude to a recession, with each of the last 8 recessions since 1969 being preceded by a yield curve inversion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 1 April 2022, the yield on the 10-year note closed at 2.38%, 6 basis points below the 2-year treasury note, which was at 2.44%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market players also assessed the latest figures from the US Labor Department&rsquo;s monthly jobs report, which shows the strength of the jobs market across the US economy.

The risk-return ratio from this volatility makes it more attractive to traders than other financial markets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are 3 commodity trading tips to help you navigate the risks of trading in this market.</span></p>\n<h2>1. Understand the factors that affect commodity prices</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commodities are cyclical, meaning their prices move in repeating patterns or recur at regular intervals. And with supply and demand as the main price drivers, they are considered much more volatile compared to forex and stocks for example. Additionally, they are highly affected by economic, political, and natural disasters.</span></p>\n<h3>Economic</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A country's economic status can affect commodity prices as it determines the purchasing strength of its population. During weak economic times, commodities are less in demand, resulting in lower prices, while a boom in the economy can increase demand, resulting in higher prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When disruptions in supply occur in countries that are major producers of a particular commodity, the price change of that commodity is higher.</span></p>\n<h3>Political</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Political uncertainty and geopolitical events in certain regions, such as social unrest like riots and protests and closures of key transport routes, can severely affect a commodity&rsquo;s supply cycle. These events usually lead to production and transportation challenges, causing a shortage of supply, resulting in more volatility.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examples of such events include the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which led to higher tariffs, and the tensions in the Middle East, which resulted in disruptions in oil supply and higher prices.</span></p>\n<h3>Natural disasters</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natural disasters and extreme weather fluctuations can negatively affect natural resource production and transportation. Typhoons, for example, can destroy crops, affecting the supply chain, causing lower supply, and market price hikes later on.</span></p>\n<h2>2. Do an in-depth market analysis</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As commodity markets are volatile in nature, both beginners and seasoned traders must monitor their price movements closely before making a trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of analysis that traders use to check how a commodity market performs &mdash; fundamental and technical analysis. Here&rsquo;s a brief explanation of what these are:</span></p>\n<h3>Fundamental analysis</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis evaluates the intrinsic or &lsquo;true&rsquo; value of an asset and determines the factors that may affect it in the future. This analysis takes into consideration external events and influences along with financial records and market trends. Traders and investors use fundamental analysis to gather information based on financial data to make rational decisions before opening positions as well as to limit personal biases.</span></p>\n<h3>Technical analysis</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technical analysis</a> uses historical price charts and market statistics to examine and predict price movements in financial markets. The idea is that by investigating previous market patterns, traders can more accurately forecast future prices. Traders use technical analysis to develop or improve their trading strategies and determine the best time to enter and exit a market.</span></p>\n<h2>3. Befriend the market trends</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market trends, whether short-term or long-term, can provide insight into potential market movements. Generally, a trend represents how the price of an asset or the commodity market is moving. An uptrend occurs when prices are rising, and a downtrend occurs when prices are declining.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In commodity trading, traders take advantage of trends to better strategise their trades as they present higher chances of possible gains since prices tend to move in the same direction.

Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weekly recovery of the US dollar failed to advance further north of the $99.00 mark over the weekend. Over the past few days, the US dollar index's (DXY) volatility was moderate, with prices attempting to consolidate around the $98.75 area. Concerns surrounding the geopolitical landscape are expected to keep propping up the demand for the US dollar, along with prospects of extra tightening by the Fed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 1-month chart above shows that the asset is currently trading over its support level at the 76.4% retracement level of $98.65, followed by a second support level at the 61.8% retracement level of $98.30 level. Since the start of March, the asset has held an upward trend and is trading under its resistance level at the $99.30 level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did other pairs react?</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ramping up of hawkish Fed comments continues to apply downward pressure on the EUR/USD, which was clinging to the $1.1000 level on Friday, 25 March 2022.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The British pound rebounded from its intraday losses but failed to reclaim the $1.3200 mark, due to factors like a risk-on market mood, Fed hawkishness, and the Bank of England's rate hike being perceived as a dovish increase. Technically speaking, on Friday, 25 March 2022, GBP/USD was trading at the $1.3180 level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD/JPY pair has remained one of the top performers for traders and has been rallying after surpassing the level of &yen;120.00 in the past few days. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) provided a bullish signal on Friday, 25 March 2022 and refrained from stepping into the markets to control the continuous rise in yields. In fact, even after the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) rose, the BoJ continued to buy an unlimited amount of bonds. Elevated US Treasury bond yields also attracted some USD dip-buying and further contributed to limiting the downside for the USD/JPY pair.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week brings many high-impact US economic reports, including the February Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data and the latest NFP figures. In light of the packed calendar, volatility is likely to pick up, setting the stage for large moves in the DXY index and financial markets in general.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/50930b31-5eb3-4f0a-a9c9-db0616bdd0a6?width=1685&amp;height=859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/50930b31-5eb3-4f0a-a9c9-db0616bdd0a6?width=1685&amp;height=859\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first half of the week, gold fluctuated above $1,920 within a relatively tight range but regained its momentum after crossing $1,950 on Thursday, 24 March 2022. Although the yellow metal struggled to maintain its bullish momentum due to the surge in US Treasury bond yields and FOMC policymakers indicating an aggressive policy tightening, it increased by around 1.16% on a weekly basis.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders are getting increasingly anxious about the global economic consequences of a prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict. Moreover, an increase in international tensions could aid the yellow metal in limiting its losses and vice versa.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, the recovery from sub-$1,900 levels paused around a resistance marked by the 38.2% retracement levels. A following drop below the 23.6% retracement level around the $1,941 mark may have altered the bias in favour of pessimistic traders, implying that more losses are likely. On the flip side, if gold finds its momentum, the next resistance level could again be 38.2% retracement near the $1,966 mark and accelerate towards the next resistance level at 50% retracement around the $1,986 mark.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices rose amid supply concerns as Houthi rebels attacked Saudi Arabia's energy assets and Russia maintained its military offensive in Ukraine. Oil ended at around $113 a barrel on Friday, 25 March 2022. Oil prices have also increased since global demand has outpaced crude production as economies recover from coronavirus.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, during a meeting with US President Joe Biden last week, EU members were split on whether or not to boycott Russian oil and gas. However, they failed to agree on a ban, and while refusing to agree to it may bring temporary relief, it does not alter the trend of rising demand and decreasing supply.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5fa5f24c-6469-4ce5-9dae-98eaab9f3cca?width=1652&amp;height=851\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5fa5f24c-6469-4ce5-9dae-98eaab9f3cca?width=1652&amp;height=851\" alt=\"Terra Luna Chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin was up by 14% in the past week, and Ethereum was up by 15%. However, on Sunday, Bitcoin was trading above the $44,600 level, whereas Ethereum topped the $3,100 mark.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Several factors have contributed to the increase in the crypto space:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The S&amp;P 500 has risen for a week straight, and Bitcoin's correlation with stocks is at a 17-month high.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin balances on exchanges are also at their lowest in more than 3 years, signalling increased demand and an interest in moving Bitcoin off exchanges via cold storage methods like hardware wallets.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ukraine officially legalised cryptocurrencies and continued accepting donations (more than $100 million to date) in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, and Dogecoin.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><br /></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best performing cryptocurrencies on the market was Terra (LUNA) which gained worldwide acclaim in light of its highly impressive price hike in the last 30 days. As a result, its management has announced plans to soon add nearly $10 billion worth of Bitcoin to its project's reserves. They believe this action would create a new monetary era for the global Bitcoin standard.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chart above represents the upward trend in its prices since the beginning of March. The asset ended the week trading right in between its resistance at the 76.4% level of $92.50 and its support at the 61.9% level at $88.70.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altcoins have been a preferred pick over the past week, but none more than Cardano (ADA). This Ethereum competitor had a rough go of it when it introduced smart contracts in 2021; the founder Charles Hoskinson said earlier this week that he was wrong about how quickly the network would accrue decentralised apps (dapps). That slow adoption stunted ADA in the initial months of 2022. However, things are now turning around, and today, the network hosts hundreds of dapps and millions of native NFTs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UK government will soon reveal plans to regulate the cryptocurrency market, focusing on a fast-growing type of token known as stablecoins. Stablecoins have seen exponential growth in terms of usage over the past few years, in tandem with rising interest in cryptocurrencies more broadly.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,861.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">308.25</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.89%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14,754.31</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">378.22</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.63%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,543.06</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">81.88</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.84%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 both gained 1.84% and 2.63% last week, respectively, while the Dow gained 0.89%. Despite falling far short of the previous week's surge, the results marked the second positive week in a row for stocks amid growing expectations of steep interest-rate increases ahead.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerns about the Federal Reserve's increasingly hawkish stance weighed on equity sentiment early in the week, prompting a bond market sell-off. The sharp year-to-date decline in bond prices accelerated, sending the 10-year US Treasury bond yield to levels not seen since May 2019. The 10-year yield jumped to 2.49% on Friday, 25 March 2022, after finishing the previous week at 2.15%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the housing industry in the United States received some bad news ahead of the often bustling spring home-buying season, as pending house sales fell for the fourth month in a row, according to a study released on Friday, 25 March 2022.

That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s crucial to be familiar with the different types of trading hoaxes out there and learn to distinguish the real from the fake. Here are a few tips from us.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Common types of trading scams</h2>\n<h3>The signal seller scam</h3>\n<p>This is one of the most common types of scams in online trading. &nbsp;A signal seller will offer a system that allegedly signals favourable trades with guaranteed profits for a fee. After a trader has paid the fees, these fake signal sellers usually disappear with the money, or they might offer false signals that only profits the broker. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The good news is that legitimate signal providers do exist. They will not promise guaranteed returns and might have independently audited records that are easy to find with some research.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>The pump &amp; dump scam</h3>\n<p>This happens when scammers spread false news to boost the value of certain assets (pump), resulting in huge buys and an inevitable increase in their value. When this happens, scammers will sell their assets (dump) and rake in the profits while traders are left to deal with the crash.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Other scams</h3>\n<p>Other online trading scams are brought about by high yield investment programs, false bots for traders, and other schemes that promise traders high returns. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Identifying legitimate brokers</h2>\n<p>With all the scammers on the online market, we need to take every precaution to avoid falling in their trap. So how do you distinguish genuine online trading platforms? Here are our recommendations:</p>\n<h3>They are generally regulated</h3>\n<p>Always make sure that the trading platform and broker is regulated. There are various regulatory bodies that monitor online trading brokers to protect traders. Unregulated brokers do not have to comply with any rules, which means you risk being unprotected from any possible misconduct by the broker.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>They verify your identity</h3>\n<p>All regulated trading brokers make it compulsory for traders to verify their personal information before trading. This is required to comply with the laws and regulations set out by the regulatory bodies. Traders typically undergo a strict verification process to authenticate their identity &mdash; this is known as a KYC (know your customer) procedure, and it varies from country to country.</p>\n<p>To ensure this isn&rsquo;t another scam to collect your personal information, find out everything you can about a broker to determine its legitimacy and to know who exactly is collecting your information.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>They have a proven track record</h3>\n<p>Make sure you do your research on a broker's reputation. Check reviews, look at what other traders are talking about in trading forums, and find out everything you can about a broker before trading.</p>\n<h3>They are not &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>If a platform&rsquo;s or broker&rsquo;s promises of high returns or consistent profits seem too good to be true, they usually are. Trust your instincts, and don&rsquo;t fall for flashy advertisements. Legitimate trading platforms never promise high profits. Remember &mdash; in trading, nothing is guaranteed.</p>\n<h3>They have reliable customer support</h3>\n<p>Genuine trading platforms and brokers will always be ready to answer your questions and help resolve any issue you may have. Plus, they will provide proper and practical ways for you to contact them. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>After you&rsquo;ve identified a legitimate broker to trade with, check out our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-for-beginners-tips-to-be-a-smart-trader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">top 3 tips on how to be a smart trader</a>, and find out <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/why-beginners-need-to-have-an-online-trading-demo-account/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">why you should start your trading journey with a demo account</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deriv is fully licensed and regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), Vanuatu Financial Services Commission, British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission, and Labuan Financial Services Authority.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US Dollar Index (DXY) managed to regain some buying interest and moved beyond the $98.00 hurdle at the end of the week. After a four-day losing streak, it began to attract some bids around $97.73. But renewed fears of an escalation in geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine brought a minor pause in the demand for risk-perceived assets, eventually resulting in a minor pullback for the DXY. Despite that, the Greenback remains around 1.5% higher for March. On the technical side, it is currently at around $98.79, well-settled above the moving average based on the six-month chart. Even though there is a bit of a fluctuation in the spikes due to the mentioned reasons above, it maintains its uptrend for now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">How did other pairs react?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a strong week, the Euro suffered from some profit-taking, causing EUR/USD to fall back to the mid - $1.10s. Due to speculation of the start of the European Central Bank&rsquo;s hiking cycle by the end of the year, the European currency faced some selling bias at the end of the week and faded from its recent uptick in the $1.1140 region.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">GBP/USD erased some of its earlier weekly losses after the Bank of England (BoE&rsquo;s) increased borrowing costs. It is worth noting that this was the third time the BoE consecutively raised their benchmark rates by a quarter to the percent.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The USD/JPY pair extended its steady intraday climb to a fresh multi-year peak &ndash; around &yen;119.10 &ndash; &yen;119.20, gaining ground on the last day of the week. The Bank of Japan stuck to its dovish stance and left its policy-setting unchanged at the end of the March meeting. This, in turn, weighed on the Japanese yen and pushed the pair higher amid a pickup in the US dollar demand.</p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bbc55e26-7fa5-4773-a7df-fc9bc1b306dc?width=1694&amp;height=844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/bbc55e26-7fa5-4773-a7df-fc9bc1b306dc?width=1694&amp;height=844\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the beginning of last week, hopes for a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict allowed risk flows to dominate financial markets, making it difficult for gold to find demand. Furthermore, on Wednesday, 16 March 2022, the US Federal Reserve announced that it would raise the policy rate by 25 basis points (bps). According to the revised Summary of Projections, policymakers expect 6 more rate hikes by the end of the year. The market's initial reaction to the Fed's hawkish rate outlook forced gold to go below the $1,900 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, there was a negative shift in risk sentiment in the second half of the week. This change aided gold's recovery as both Russia and Ukraine officials denied reports that they were getting closer to a peace agreement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As seen in the monthly chart above, gold is currently trading at around $1,925.75, close to its moving average. The 14-day RSI is just below the 50 level mark at about 49.93, suggesting further selling may be likely. If this momentum persists, it may have an expected bearish market trend.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since late February, gold's reaction to changes in risk sentiment has been fairly straightforward. If this week's developments indicate a further conflict escalation, gold should rally and begin regaining last week's losses. On the other hand, if markets remain optimistic about a cease-fire, the precious metal may face renewed selling pressure.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, Oil prices found a floor above $100 per barrel on Friday, 18 March 2022, following a week of volatile trading. Since there's no easy replacement for Russian barrels in sight, the market is already characterised by tight supply.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rise in oil prices and other commodities exported by Russia has also fueled inflation fears as governments seek to stimulate growth in the aftermath of the pandemic. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week and signalled further increases to match the pace of the rise in prices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, &nbsp;the recent surge in COVID-19 cases and the fact that closures in China are in place now may threaten the oil demand. Lastly, with nuclear proliferation talks making little progress, the possibility of Iran supplying additional barrels has also contributed to the volatility in the oil prices.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/45ba20cd-fd26-459b-9741-a0cea69e9e07?width=1688&amp;height=850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/45ba20cd-fd26-459b-9741-a0cea69e9e07?width=1688&amp;height=850\" alt=\"Bitcoin Chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US Federal Reserve's long-awaited announcement of interest rate hikes kept Bitcoin's price above $40,000. For the first time in 3 years, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. After weeks of low volatility, Bitcoin's price experienced a surge, skyrocketing by $3,000 in one day.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Technically, at the start of the week, Bitcoin was trading close to the 23.6% retracement level at around $38,900, followed by an uptrend and then range-bound between 50% and 61.8% retracement levels. As per the monthly chart above, it went above the 61.8% retracement level for a brief time. However, it reverted to range-bound until it breached the major resistance level at 61.8% around the $41,500 mark and hit the next resistance level at 76.4% around the $42,500 mark. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around the $42,983.56 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite a soaring US dollar, declining Bitcoin mining, and falling NFT interest, Bitcoin is still impressively hovering around $40,000.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several leading cryptocurrencies rallied more than 10% in the last week, with Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche posting some of the highest gains.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By market capitalisation, Avalanche had the most significant growth last week among the top 20 cryptocurrencies. Avalanche shot up by almost 30% to hit the $90 mark. While it's 37.5% off its former all-time high of $146.22, set 4 months ago, this is by far the biggest rise for a leading cryptocurrency in the last 7 days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both Solana and Cardano, 2 other smart contract giants, rose by more than 11% and 12%, respectively.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,754.93</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,809.69</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.49%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14,420.08</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,373.44</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10.53%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,463.12</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">290.01</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6.95%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The major US market indices gained by around 5.50% to 10.50% last week, regaining all ground lost in the previous two weeks. Multiple factors supported the market, including falling oil prices, news that Russia avoided defaulting on its sovereign debt and the outcome of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting. While tensions in Ukraine continued, market sentiment was sustained this week by ongoing talks to end the conflict.

We take a look at the different factors that affect a currency’s exchange rate in this blog post.","blog_post":"<p>As the biggest and one of the most accessible financial markets to trade in, the forex market holds plenty of trading opportunities for traders all over the world. <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Forex trading</a> is essentially the exchange of one currency for another, and the value of both currencies are measured against each other. This is called an exchange rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There are typically two types of exchange rates &mdash; fixed rates and floating rates. If a currency has a fixed rate, its value is pegged to the value of another currency and maintained until the local government adjusts the official exchange rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, if a currency has a floating rate, its value is determined by forces in the forex market through supply and demand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what are these forces that affect floating exchange rates? And what factors should a trader consider when predicting how a currency value will move?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we go through important factors that affect the mid- and long-term trends of foreign exchange rates and the value of currencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Interest rates</h2>\n<p>A high interest rate leads to higher currency values, as it will attract foreign investment and increase the demand for the local currency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The interest rate is an amount that is charged to a borrower as a cost for using the capital or asset that they borrow, and is a percentage of the total amount borrowed. This represents the rate of return for the investor, which is the gains or losses of the investment.</p>\n<p>When interest rates offered by a country are high, foreign investors will be more willing to invest in the country as they will receive a higher rate of return &mdash; or higher gains &mdash; from their investment over time. When foreign capital is poured into the local country as investment, the foreign currency has to be converted into the local currency. This pushes up the demand for local currency and raises its value.</p>\n<p>Interest rates are determined by central banks, so it&rsquo;s good to keep an eye on important announcements made by them.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Inflation</h2>\n<p>Inflation occurs when rising costs of goods and services lead to the decline of a currency&rsquo;s purchasing power. The measurement of a currency&rsquo;s purchasing power is a strong indicator of its value, and can be observed through a country&rsquo;s level of inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Inflation occurs when goods and services become more expensive. This can happen either because of rising production costs thanks to more expensive raw materials or services, or because of an increased demand. This in turn pushes up the prices of goods and services as either they become more expensive to produce or production fails to meet increasing demand.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If inflation is high, it would cost a consumer more money to buy the goods and services compared to previously, meaning the currency has less purchasing power. The measurement of a currency&rsquo;s purchasing power is a strong indicator of its value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If inflation is low, a currency is strengthened because its purchasing power is high &mdash; one unit of the currency is able to buy more. This leads to an increase in demand for that currency, which in turn raises its value.</p>\n<h2>International trade</h2>\n<p>A currency&rsquo;s value can also be affected by the balance of trade between countries &mdash; the balance of trade refers to the difference between a country&rsquo;s imports and exports. Countries with higher exports will usually experience an increase in their currency&rsquo;s value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s say demand for UK products increases. Countries that want to import UK products will need to convert their currency to British pound sterling to buy UK products. This will then increase the demand for pound sterling as countries are buying more products with the currency, which will then boost its value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>International trade is also affected by a country&rsquo;s inflation rate.</p>\n<p>For example, if the US has a high inflation rate, buying US-made products and services becomes more expensive as the US dollar's purchasing power has decreased. There will be less demand for the US dollar, thus leading to a decreasing value and exchange rate.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Economic and political stability</h2>\n<p>International trade is closely related to a country&rsquo;s economic health. Economic health can be measured by a number of factors, including GDP, inflation, as well as a country&rsquo;s current account and balance of payments &mdash; the difference between how much a country spends and how much it earns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If a country spends more to import foreign trade compared to what it earns, their balance is in deficit. They would need more foreign capital to buy foreign products, resulting in a lower demand for local currency and a decrease in the local currency&rsquo;s value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A currency&rsquo;s exchange rate and perceived value are also strongly affected by a country&rsquo;s political stability. Solid financial and economic policies determined by a stable government will greatly contribute to confidence in a currency and the economy as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When people are confident and optimistic about an economy&rsquo;s future expansion and growth, they will be more willing to invest in the local currency. This will increase demand for the currency, and thus strengthen its value.</p>\n<h2>Speculation</h2>\n<p>The forex market and currency exchange rates can also react to speculations. For example, if speculators anticipate a rise in currency value in response to political events or global news, investors will buy more of it in the hopes of making a profit by selling it when prices rise. This leads to an increase in demand, resulting in an increase in the currency&rsquo;s value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is important to note that there are many factors that contribute to currency exchange rates and price movements, leading to potentially significant volatility in the forex market.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So in addition to considering the factors mentioned above in a fundamental analysis, make use of <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical analysis</a> to support your strategy and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/top-4-trading-styles-choose-the-one-that-suits-you-best/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trading style</a> when you trade forex.

We have prepared the list of main dos and don’ts to help you get started.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD (contract for difference) trading allows you to speculate on the price movement of different assets without actually buying them.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The high risk, high reward nature, and the increasing popularity of this trading type attract new traders daily. However, beginners may feel a little lost at first. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s essential to establish a solid foundation before diving into CFD trading. In this article, we will share some tips and best practices to help you get started.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dos: the best practices of CFD trading&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3>Choose a reliable broker and the right platform</h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is absolutely necessary to check the credibility of any institution involved in your financial activities. The same applies to CFD brokers &ndash; the companies providing the CFD trading services. You need to make sure the broker you choose is regulated and its licences are legitimate and updated. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to check the </span><a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reviews</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of other traders and select the right user-friendly platform that will suit your trading needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at Deriv, we aim to provide the best trading experience for our customers. That&rsquo;s why we keep all our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/regulatory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">regulatory information</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the open access. We also offer two options for CFD trading: the popular Deriv MT5 (DMT5) platform and the new fully customisable Deriv X platform. Our customers can trade CFDs on forex, stocks and stock indices, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and our exclusive synthetic indices on these platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Do your homework</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many CFD trading terms are likely to be unfamiliar to beginners. Do your own research about the commonly used tools and terms before you place your first trade. Once you feel comfortable, you can create a risk-free </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with Deriv to try out the practical aspect of your newly obtained knowledge. It is loaded with virtual 10,000 USD and will give you a perfect opportunity to learn CFD trading in detail.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, learning doesn&rsquo;t end there. As the trading industry keeps evolving, you may encounter unfamiliar terms or concepts occasionally. To stay abreast, check the latest trading updates posted by your broker or seek advice from the online trading communities. After all, even experts need to refresh their knowledge periodically.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Diversify your portfolio but keep it balanced</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With so many assets across various financial markets to trade on, CFD trading can quickly become overwhelming for some traders. Don't spread yourself thin trying to learn about all the markets and assets at once, but don't focus all your attention on one particular asset or market either. Find a balance that works for you personally.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a starting point, it&rsquo;s better to focus on 2-3 assets and markets only. For example, if you decide to trade CFDs on stocks, choose stocks that belong to different industries, and try trading CFDs on indices too. It will give you a chance to study the markets in-depth and understand how the prices react to various triggers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diversifying your portfolio across industries may also help you avoid losing more than you are comfortable with if an asset in one industry doesn&rsquo;t perform well.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&rsquo;ts: things to avoid when you trade CFDs</span></h2>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Don't over-leverage your account</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most traders prefer to trade CFDs on margin, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also referred to as leveraged trading. Trading on leverage means that you only need to pay a certain percentage of the asset value to open a trade while your broker covers the rest. Leverage allows you to enter the market with larger positions but smaller initial capital. Leverage may vary depending on the market you trade on, your country&rsquo;s regulation, the broker you choose and several other factors.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using leverage is a great way to open larger trades, which can lead to larger profits too. But while it can increase profits, losses are also amplified. The rule of thumb here is that as long as you are able to pay the total amount of your trade, not just a percentage, you are safe. And if you can't afford that, chances are you set your leverage number too high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also use stop loss to minimise potential losses. Stop loss is a handy little feature in CFD trading that automatically closes your trade if your loss reaches the amount you&rsquo;ve set; that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s highly recommended to have it set for all your trades.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Don't fall prey to emotions when trading</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When faced with potential loss, many traders start making impulsive decisions to win their money back, which usually leads to even more losses. Stick to a trading strategy and understand the reason for your loss, rather than emotionally placing a trade just to recover your money.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of emotional trading is when people develop an emotional attachment to certain assets. But no matter how you feel about their future price movements, don&rsquo;t change your plan. Stick to your initial strategy.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget about the overnight fee</strong></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s a common practice among CFD brokers to charge an overnight fee on open positions. It&rsquo;s very important to bear it in mind and make sure that it&rsquo;s worth keeping your trades open overnight.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you have an unprofitable trade, and you hope to recover and turn it into a profitable one the next day. If the market still goes against your prediction, you&rsquo;ll end up with an even bigger loss and an extra fee to pay for keeping your position open overnight. The same applies to the trades with a very small profit. The overnight fee may just wipe the profit out. So it&rsquo;s always better to review and consider the trades you are not sure about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, sometimes keeping a trade open overnight can bring you even higher profit. However, you need to define a time frame within which you expect to see a profit on that particular trade. If it&rsquo;s not profitable by a certain time, review it and decide if it&rsquo;s worth keeping.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">__</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are, of course, many more lessons to learn on the way to becoming a successful CFD trader, but knowing some of the essential dos and don'ts is the first and foremost step.

The APP will be worth 40 billion euros in April, 30 billion in May, and 20 billion in June. President Christine Lagarde stated that inflation is likely to stabilise with the central bank's target to bring it down to 2% in the medium term and that Moscow's invasion of Ukraine is a watershed moment for Europe, with a material impact on economic activity and inflation. As a result, the central bank revised its growth forecast downward and predicted rising inflationary pressures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US dollar, on the other hand, resumed gains against the British Pound. Last week, the GBP/USD set a new 2022 low, closing at the lowest level since November 2020. The war between Russia and Ukraine has weighed heavily on the pound, pushing the GBP/USD to $1.30.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">USD/JPY raced past its 2022 high of &yen;116.35 touching a four-year high on Friday, 11 March 2022. This momentum was caused due to a confluence of factors. Normally, during times of geopolitical uncertainty, the Japanese Yen appreciates due to its 'safe-haven' appeal. However, since the invasion of Ukraine, the Japanese Yen has been a rather frustrating pair to watch due to its tendency to trade sideways.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With Japan importing roughly 80% of its oil consumption, rising oil prices will increase import costs, putting downward pressure on the Yen. In contrast, the US dollar is receiving a safe-haven bid and has remained elevated since the FOMC began talking up the likelihood of a March 2022 rate hike in response to multi-decade inflation.</p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a2b0e8d7-8059-4640-8788-44767849db98?width=1730&amp;height=875\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a2b0e8d7-8059-4640-8788-44767849db98?width=1730&amp;height=875\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

There is a possibility that the yellow metal's initial decline was due to developments in the Ukraine-Russia peace talks. However, weekend comments from Moscow and Kyiv suggest that the policymakers are far from ready to step back. A firmer US Treasury yield, as well as pessimism surrounding China's Coronavirus situation, may also weigh on market sentiment, as well as gold prices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though talks surround a halt in the production of gold, India's ramping gold demand, as well as inflation fears, keep the yellow metal on the bull's radar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gold prices remained over 4% higher on the month. The yellow metal is also benefiting from higher volatility across equity markets, driving its appeal as a haven asset. While traders will closely watch the Fed's rate decisions, the ongoing and rapidly changing situation in Ukraine could overshadow the FOMC meeting. A large part of that results from the economic uncertainty that has affected the global economy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chart above shows that gold is currently trading below the 50 SMA and 100 SMA at $1,978.48 and $1,986.30, respectively. The recent decline could be a technical correction in response to the sharp uptrend that began early in February.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oil prices fell on the morning of Sunday, 13 March 2022, extending last week's decline, as a US official said Russia might be willing to engage in substantive talks over Ukraine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As of the last session on Sunday, 13 March 2022, WTI crude oil prices remain pressured at around $105.00 following a recent 14-year high. The black gold reacted to the market's increased optimism over Russia-Ukraine&rsquo;s peace talks and hoped that the US and China may resolve their differences.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/40ace4f7-3c0a-4f8e-9c26-897ab8660ba6?width=1732&amp;height=880\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/40ace4f7-3c0a-4f8e-9c26-897ab8660ba6?width=1732&amp;height=880\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

Barring Avalanche, nearly all the leading altcoins were trading lower on Friday, 11 March 2022. Bitcoin and BNB each fell by 6%, whilst Ether, the number two cryptocurrency, fell by 5%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin has traded sideways for over a month without any major breakout. It has increasingly tested the strong demand zones of $34,200 &ndash; $34,400 and the important supply zones of $45,500 &ndash; $45,800. Based on the listed support and resistance levels, traders should watch for major breakouts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The world's largest cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $39,190. On the technical chart above, Bitcoin finds its primary support level at about $38,536 at the 38.2% retracement level. Below this, the secondary support for Bitcoin is $37,050, at 23.6% retracement. On the upside, the first resistance level is located at around 39,740 at 50% retracement, followed by $40,945 at 61.8% retracement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On a weekly timeframe, Bitcoin's performance represented a 7.8% decline. Yet another late selloff unfolded as traders chose to secure their positions early, considering the risk of heightened tensions and additional weekend volatility for the crypto markets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The global cryptocurrency market capitalisation dipped to $1.72 trillion on Friday, 11 March 2022, representing a loss of nearly 5% within 24 hours. Meanwhile, the total cryptocurrency trading volumes dropped as much as 9% to around $88.9 billion.</p>\n<h2><strong>US Indices&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">32,944.19</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">126.81</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.39%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">13,301.83</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-17.55</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.13%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,204.31</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.22</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">0.08%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />Source: Bloomberg&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stocks ended a volatile week mixed after late gains turned into losses on Friday, 11 March 2022, following diplomatic progress between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 126.8 points last week, seeing a 0.39% increase. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 Index traded flat at around 4,204 whilst the Nasdaq Composite tumbled to -17.55%. All three major indices led the week with gains but ended with a sell-off.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Global markets continued to struggle with the economic and financial implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, market sentiment does appear to have shifted from extreme fear to something resembling concern.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The US 10-year Treasury prices fell on Friday, 11 March 2022, pushing the yield above 2% from its March low of 1.73%. As traders moved into bonds during Russia's invasion and out again after headlines began to ease, the rise in yields was a blow to tech stocks and the Nasdaq Composite.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The benchmark US Treasury yield is close to its pandemic-era high, and any break above this level could signal a sustainable path higher. Moreover, this would serve as a hit for the high-growth tech companies, as higher long-dated bond yields eat into the value of future profits.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week's focus will also shift back to the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point following its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, 16 March 2022. More importantly, the markets will closely watch policymakers' projections of how far rates may rise this year and across 2023 and 2024 to tame inflationary pressures.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br />Trade the financial markets with options and multipliers <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial</span> and Financial STP accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Options trading, and the Deriv X platform, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Cryptocurrency trading is not available for clients residing within the United Kingdom.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","published_date":"2022-03-14"},{"id":"e5615ea7-a1be-4306-9725-cf576846aaf9","main_image":{"id":"18d943ac-0bc4-4c49-8d2c-f35f44c1d314","description":"Learn cryptocurrency trading for beginners on Deriv in our blog","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/cac11/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/89239/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.jpg 150w,\n/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/2c227/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.jpg 300w,\n/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/cac11/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.jpg 600w,\n/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/751a4/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/49f80/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.webp 150w,\n/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/de298/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.webp 300w,\n/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/52493/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.webp 600w,\n/static/3d10dee02211479d557aed5531526140/1eb60/Cryptocurrency%20trading%20for%20beginners.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"cryptocurrency-trading-for-beginners-on-deriv","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_uk","tags":[{"id":"156","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Deriv GO"}},{"id":"157","tags_id":{"tag_name":"CFDs"}},{"id":"158","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Multipliers"}},{"id":"159","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Deriv X"}},{"id":"160","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Deriv MT5"}},{"id":"161","tags_id":{"tag_name":"DBot"}},{"id":"162","tags_id":{"tag_name":"DTrader"}},{"id":"163","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}}],"blog_title":"Cryptocurrency trading for beginners on Deriv","blog_description":"A quick guide on cryptocurrency trading for beginners.

The quote restarted its trading this week with an upside gap, rising 0.63% intraday which resulted in new highs for the week.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Economic data from the US came in above expectations but it made no difference on market sentiment. There was a 678K increase in payroll in February, more than the expected 407K &mdash; making it the best month since July 2021. The unemployment rate dropped from 4% to 3.8% (even as the labour participation rate rose), and average hourly earnings stagnated in February against expectations of a 0.5% increase.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EUR/USD continues its four-week downtrend, hitting a fresh multi-day low as the trading week ended. Last week, this major currency pair dropped to its lowest levels since May 2020. In addition to the risk-off mood, the Fed is facing escalating pressure to lift its benchmark rates at a faster pace as inflation increases.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">USD/JPY broke to the downside falling to &yen;114.90, its lowest level since Wednesday&rsquo;s Asian session. And GBP/USD is battling $1.3200 after hitting fresh 2022 lows at $1.3185, amid the Ukraine crisis-led risk-aversion and a firmer US dollar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">AUD/USD rallied for the third day in a row, closing the week in green. The pair faced strong resistance near $0.7369 even after the US Department of Labor reported that the US economy added more jobs than expected.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We await the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February this week as well as the decision of the European Central Bank on its monetary policy meeting for fresh stimulus. Close attention will also be paid to Russia-Ukraine headlines.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/001a58e2-2a66-49d0-b719-05621a985662\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/001a58e2-2a66-49d0-b719-05621a985662\" alt=\"Commodities Chart on Deriv\" width=\"1730\" height=\"878\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oil prices soared last week to decade-level highs as geopolitical troubles in Ukraine and looming US sanctions pushed the energy markets higher.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The global benchmark, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose $19.96, or 20.85%, to settle at $115 &mdash; its highest close since 2014. And Brent Crude gained 15.9%, closing Friday&rsquo;s session above $118 a barrel.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prices were pushed higher from the news that the United States and its allies were engaged in a &ldquo;very active discussion&rdquo; on a potential embargo of Russian oil and natural gas imports, according to US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Russian-supplied oil to the US last year accounted for only 3% of total crude shipments that arrived to the US, making a short-term trade ban highly plausible. However, Europe is far more dependent with an estimated 30% of its oil supplies coming from Russia, so it may not follow suit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Brent Crude could end the year at $185 if Russia&rsquo;s energy supplies continue to be disrupted, according to JPMorgan Chase. They predict that without any Russian barrels, oil prices could go as high as $150 within the next three months.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile in the metal markets, gold rose sharply &nbsp;amidst panic in the equity markets. The yellow metal hit $2,000 last week, its highest level since mid-2020. Last week&rsquo;s rally took gold&rsquo;s price back above its 50-,100-, and 200-day simple moving average, trading around $1,990 mark at the time of writing.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e7a78ce3-fa82-42bf-a7f1-087a052a33c0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e7a78ce3-fa82-42bf-a7f1-087a052a33c0\" alt=\"Cryptocurrency Chart on Deriv\" width=\"1733\" height=\"875\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin traded below some critical support zones last week after a late sell-off cost the cryptocurrency its key $40,000 level. After its latest run above $44,000 earlier in the week, Bitcoin failed to preserve this trend, pushing back to its average range for 2022 at around the $39,000 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin may be tested at its primary support level at around $37,050 levels at the 26.6% retracement level. Any upwards momentum would bring Bitcoin&rsquo;s initial resistance level into play at around $38,540. Above this lies Bitcoin&rsquo;s secondary level of resistance at $39,470, at 50% retracement.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Due to the short-term flight to safety taking over market sentiment, gold and the US dollar have profited at the expense of Bitcoin. Market commentators have ascribed the downturn of the crypto markets simply to short-term panic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Proponents of Bitcoin are known to have called the asset &ldquo;digital gold&rdquo; &mdash; the idea that Bitcoin is a safe haven and store of value in times of market turmoil. This argument resurfaced as Bitcoin reached $44,000 as the war in Ukraine intensified.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But prominent market commentators have disagreed with this notion. &ldquo;Crypto has aggressively sold off since it was clear the Fed were going to hike rates faster than anticipated which in turn saw stocks sell off. This is not the definition of a safe haven,&rdquo; remarked Lux Thiagarajah, BCB Group&rsquo;s head of trading.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What&rsquo;s clear is that cryptocurrencies in general continue to be a key talking point during Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine for its potential ability to evade economic sanctions. With major financial institutions being placed on a US sanctions list that prohibits business and the movement of money, this has led to a debate about whether cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which are decentralised in nature, could be a financial loophole that evades such restrictions.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>33,614.80</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-277.80</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.82%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>13,837.83</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-399.98</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.81%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>4,328.87</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-45.07</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>-1.03%</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last week, markets were volatile but showed resilience as solid economic data helped alleviate some of the rising geopolitical concerns. However, the conflict in Ukraine is having a more significant impact on several aspects, most notably commodity prices, inflation, and interest rates.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Economic events appeared to play a secondary role in shaping sentiment, despite traders paying close attention to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's Congressional testimony on Wednesday and Thursday. Powell stated that it was \"too early to say\" whether Russia's invasion would affect the Fed's policy in the medium term but that policymakers would \"move cautiously\". Powell also stated that he was inclined to keep the federal funds rate at a quarter-point increase in March, putting to rest fears of a 50-basis-point (0.50%) increase.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, the price of US government bonds increased, causing yields to fall dramatically. The 10-year US Treasury bond yield began the week at 1.92%, dipped to as low as 1.68% on Tuesday (3 March 2022), then stabilised at 1.73% on Friday, indicating an increase in volatility.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a> or CFDs on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Options trading, and the Deriv X platform, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>Cryptocurrency trading is not available for clients residing within the United Kingdom.</em></p>","published_date":"2022-03-07"},{"id":"8448e156-d2c2-4c40-a10d-6c71bc7ec5af","main_image":{"id":"ac195132-de60-4980-8e8a-cecf5acb282a","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/cac11/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/89239/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.jpg 150w,\n/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/2c227/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.jpg 300w,\n/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/cac11/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.jpg 600w,\n/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/751a4/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/49f80/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.webp 150w,\n/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/de298/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.webp 300w,\n/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/52493/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.webp 600w,\n/static/b6e138361acb0adddb1a6245d291f2d6/1eb60/Deriv%20X%20-%20Blog%20-%201280x768%203.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"deriv-x-a-customisable-cfd-trading-platform","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_eu_uk","tags":[{"id":"149","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Deriv X"}},{"id":"165","tags_id":{"tag_name":"CFDs"}}],"blog_title":"Deriv X — a customisable CFD trading platform","blog_description":"We explore Deriv X — a customisable CFD trading platform designed for a personalised trading experience.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You're about to discover a CFD trading platform designed to offer you a more personalised trading experience &mdash; Deriv X.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv X allows you to create a trading environment that suits your needs.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar index (DXY) began last week by capitalising on safe-haven flows amid rising geopolitical tensions. Among the pairs that reacted to this, the EUR/USD hit a fresh 2022 low of $1.11118 just as markets opened. Furthermore, the USD/JPY pair opened at &yen;115.14 and hit a high of &yen;115.78 shortly after the announcement that Ukraine and Russia would hold their first diplomatic talks since the Kremlin invasion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday, 21 February 2022, the Russian rouble was reported to have lost more than 40% against the US dollar on the interbank market. In response, the central bank of Russia raised its benchmark interest rate to 20%. The central bank said that the rate hike is intended to offset depreciation risks and inflation risks associated with the rouble.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the first time, the European Union (EU) decided to provide weapons aid to a nation at war. According to Reuters, the EU will send 450 million euros worth of weaponry to its eastern neighbour. In addition to that, over the weekend, the US and the EU and other Western nations decided to exclude some Russian financial institutions from the global payment system, SWIFT.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/165336c7-9601-4a5d-b5e0-1321a30b1402\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/165336c7-9601-4a5d-b5e0-1321a30b1402\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" width=\"1679\" height=\"821\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold could not build on its previous week's gains because of the improved market mood at the start of last week. This sentiment was fuelled by renewed hopes of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. As gold was the most vulnerable asset to a shift in risk perception, its price fluctuated wildly throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a rally to its highest level since September 2020 at $1,974, gold fell below $1,900 early in the American session on Friday, 25 February 2022, ending a three-week winning streak. The chart above shows that gold is currently trading at $1,900.84. Gold's RSI indicator sits at 46.3 and is just above the 50 SMA at $1,900.64 and below the 100 SMA and 200 SMA levels at $1,912.97 and $1,909.28.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the oil markets, WTI Crude oil hit $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014, as global geopolitical concerns turned into a visible threat with Russian President Vladimir Putin announcing a military operation in Ukraine. However, it could not sustain this high for long and retreated, but did not drop below $90 per barrel.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a second consecutive increase in domestic crude oil inventories for the week ending on Thursday, 24 February 2022. According to EIA data, US commercial crude stockpiles increased by 4.5 million barrels last week totalling to 416 million barrels, putting them at about 9% below the five-year average.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week's economic calendar will include several high-level data releases, but traders are likely to remain focused on geopolitical headlines. Last week's market action demonstrated that gold is the preferred safe-haven asset, but it is also the first to be sold when sentiment improves. If Russia reaffirms its intention to seek a diplomatic solution and refrains from advancing its troops early this week, gold may face additional selling pressure. On the other hand, a protracted military conflict with Russia's intent to take over Kyiv and additional sanctions from the West could support the precious metal.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,058.75</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">462.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14,189.16</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">318.63</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2.30%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,384.65</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">79.89</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.86%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global stock markets were highly volatile last week as traders reacted to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Following a midweek sell-off in equities, markets swiftly recovered during the week's late trading sessions.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Tuesday, 22 February 2022, risk assets fell as traders assessed the financial market's reaction to escalating military tensions and increased sanctions against Russia.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US indices extended losses on Wednesday, 23 February 2022, pushing the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 to their lowest levels in 2022. Despite steep declines the previous day, all three indices climbed on Friday, 25 February 2022. Based on Bloomberg data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 1.38% higher at around $33,502. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 also ended in the green, closing higher at 1.86% and 2.30%, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the US released its initial set of sanctions against Russian financial institutions and sovereign debt, hopes of a diplomatic resolution between Russia and Ukraine appeared to dim. However, on Friday, 25 February 2022, market sentiment boosted after the Kremlin reportedly announced that Vladimir Putin was ready to send a delegation for negotiations with Ukraine.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For US traders, geopolitical tensions will further complicate the Federal Reserve's next economic policy move, which has thus far prioritised reducing inflationary pressures via hawkish monetary policy changes. Increasing prices from the escalating conflict would complicate Fed policy, causing the Fed to have to decide whether to increase rates in the midst of an energy-stressed, slowing economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a> or CFDs on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Options trading, and the Deriv X platform, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>","published_date":"2022-02-28"},{"id":"7d9e93d0-5fdf-4c54-9365-2899b8983c90","main_image":{"id":"29962382-57f7-4044-84c0-ad5c2132fce0","description":"Automated trading on Deriv with DBot, the trading platform that lets you build your bot without coding.","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/cac11/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/89239/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.jpg 150w,\n/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/2c227/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.jpg 300w,\n/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/cac11/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.jpg 600w,\n/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/751a4/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/49f80/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.webp 150w,\n/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/de298/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.webp 300w,\n/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/52493/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.webp 600w,\n/static/2167ba04189a75363bb06e915bda6f34/1eb60/Automated%20trading%20%E2%80%93%20what%20you%20need%20to%20know.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"automated-trading-what-you-need-to-know","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"72","tags_id":{"tag_name":"DBot"}}],"blog_title":"Automated trading: what you need to know","blog_description":"Find out what automated trading is, how trading robots work, and why you should use one.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many moving parts in online trading. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you need to learn how to trade. Second, you'll need a trading strategy. Third, you&rsquo;ll need to test out that strategy. Finally, you must keep track of your trades so you can maximise your profits when you win or limit your losses when your predictions go against you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This process may appear easy, but if you have been trading for some time, you&rsquo;d know that it involves a lot of repetitive tasks and there&rsquo;s actually a lot of technical and fundamental analysis to do. The good news is, with automated trading, you can automate your trades so that you won&rsquo;t have to stare at your screen all day.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to modern technology, auto trading bots are easy to create and only require minimal effort to deploy. Plus, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about hiring a programmer to build a trading robot for you, and there's no need to learn how to code.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we&rsquo;ll walk you through what automated trading is, how trading robots work, and why you should use one for trading.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is automated trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Automated trading is a financial trading method where you set and execute your trading decisions with the help of a trading robot.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">utomated trading system (ATS) is a subset of algorithmic trading. It uses a computer program to generate trade orders and automatically executes them.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trade orders are dependent on your technical analysis and the parameters you've set.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do trading robots work?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e476f4ed-b434-48de-8c79-ffacc2e2c130\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e476f4ed-b434-48de-8c79-ffacc2e2c130\" alt=\"A trading bot analysing numbers.\" width=\"3120\" height=\"2080\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In automated trading, a trading robot interacts with the online trading platform via an </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">application program interface (API). This API acts as the middleman which t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">akes your requests, tells the trading robot what you want it to do, and delivers back the responses to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you enable your trading robot, it will automatically enter, monitor, and exit trades based on the rules you have set. The good thing about some trading robots is that you don&rsquo;t need to learn how to code. One great example is Deriv's <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dbot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DBot</a>.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c942e09c-2438-4a24-9d79-21ba3eafb739\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c942e09c-2438-4a24-9d79-21ba3eafb739\" alt=\"DBot with a running bot\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1116\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DBot trading platform has a drag-and-drop robot builder that is customisable. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All you need to do is select the blocks and indicators to match your trading strategy. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use simple formulas to get yourself started, but you can also create sophisticated algorithms. The trading robot you build then does all the trading for you, so you do not have</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to stay glued to your computer all the time.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why use trading robots</span></h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bot, your rules</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading bots eliminate the need for constant market monitoring. It will keep track of the markets on your behalf all day long, so you can take advantage of every trading opportunity. This means that you won't have to be tethered physically to your trade terminal. With a trading robot, you just have to set the rules, and it executes them, enabling you to manage your trades more efficiently.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotionless trading</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading involves money, and emotions come along with it. A lot of traders are influenced by fear and greed when making trading decisions. Fear of loss can make traders hesitate before taking a trading position, leading to lost opportunities. Likewise, too much greed for greater profits may force a trader to hold on to a position for too long or make reckless decisions, which may also cause financial losses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A trading robot enables trading without emotions. It will not think twice about making decisions since it works based on your preset commands.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Round-the-clock trading</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading robots don't sleep, which means you can trade at any time and from anywhere. It does not require constant monitoring, so you can catch market movements even while you're away. It's just a matter of setting your desired specifications and letting the trading robot do the work.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disciplined trading</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discipline and patience are two essential attributes that distinguish great traders from the rest. They are constantly refining their strategies and making decisions based on the data they collect.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a trading robot, you can examine your trade history and apply what you've learned to future trades.

However, it was still down for the week as a series of developments in the Ukraine-Russia situation jittered traders. The US dollar index was down by around -0.34% for the week. Currently, the US dollar index is trading at approximately $95.78. The monthly chart above shows multiple support levels at the 100 SMA and 200 SMA at $95.44 and $93.76, respectively. On the other hand, the US dollar index is trading just below the resistance level of 50 SMA at around $95.97.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the other pairs react?</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUR/USD pair ended the week with little movement, trading in the $1.1350 - $1.1360 price range. The sentiment about geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine dominated financial activity. Additionally, the US Federal Reserve meeting minutes failed to provide new hints on monetary policy.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD, up for the third week in a row, remained resilient to the Russia-Ukraine crisis despite UK inflation rising and raising expectations of increased rate hikes by the Bank of England (BOE). On the other hand, the January Fed minutes disappointed hawks and triggered a new wave of US dollar selling.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD/JPY's movement was primarily driven by Russia's intentions in Ukraine and the news surrounding the military and diplomatic situation. On Thursday, 17 February 2022, USD/JPY closed at &yen;114.91, its lowest level in 2 weeks, after unverified artillery exchange reports triggered safe-haven flows to the yen. The USD/JPY rose above &yen;115.00 following an agreement for US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow next week. However, the standoff continues to have market ramifications.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week's focus would be on CPI data (January) for the Eurozone, the Consumer Confidence Index and Fed Monetary Policy Report for the US and the inflation report hearings in the UK by the Bank of England. Despite a relatively light data week, the central underlying theme will be geopolitical developments involving Russia and Ukraine.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/8a0f05ec-736c-4030-aa96-f85cb51356f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/8a0f05ec-736c-4030-aa96-f85cb51356f7\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" width=\"1687\" height=\"866\" /></a><br /><br /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

However, this pullback could be short-lived, as \"lingering and still unresolved tensions will continue to support bullion\", says RJO Futures senior market analyst Bob Haberkorn. Regardless of the slump, the gold price rose by 1.9% maintaining its uptrend for the third consecutive week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the monthly chart above, gold is currently trading at around $1,896.76, marginally close to its 50-day and 100-day moving averages at $1,895.18 and $1,893.84, respectively, and well above its 200-day moving average at $1,877.25.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil prices took a hit following reports that a nuclear agreement with Iran was \"closer than ever.\" If a deal is reached, Iran could return about 1.3 million barrels per day (BPD) to the market following the lifting of US sanctions. This prospect pushed oil prices to their first weekly decline in 9 weeks on Friday, 18 February 2022. Although escalating tensions over the Ukraine-Russia crisis did not offer significant support, the uncertainty could potentially push prices higher.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 18 February 2022, the benchmark WTI Crude was trading around $91.07 a barrel, closing 4.6% lower on the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the oil markets are currently unpredictable, there is a high probability that OPEC+ will stick to the production hike strategy of 400,000 BPD by April 2022 to maintain some normality and stable long-term conditions.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/993f97d2-98fa-46e7-a318-10e9d145c494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/993f97d2-98fa-46e7-a318-10e9d145c494\" alt=\"Bitcoin Chart on Deriv\" width=\"1682\" height=\"866\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The world's largest cryptocurrency shed around 6% last week, trading lows of about $39,858 as the standoff between Russia and Ukraine continued to spook traders.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically speaking, the chart above shows Bitcoin's current primary support at $36,450, whilst any upside potential would see its primary resistance level of $39,913 at 38.2% retracement come into action. A breach of this level would introduce $41,013 as its new primary resistance level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number two cryptocurrency, Ether, continued to mirror Bitcoin's price movements with a weekly loss of almost 7%. During Friday's morning session, Ethereum failed to uphold its major support level at $2,900 and was further hit with a wave of selling that dropped Ether to an intraday low of around $2,750.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst last week's sell-off placed most of the top 20 cryptocurrencies in the red, only Avalanche (AVAX) ended the week positively, posting an interesting 3%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Wall Street has gone into full de-risking mode, and Bitcoin is paying the price\", OANDA senior market analyst Edward Moya commented. \"Fears over geopolitical concerns and potentially aggressive central bank tightening has cryptos across the board in free fall.\"</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the rise of government scrutiny on the US cryptocurrency market poses an additional threat to long-term price movements. In a recent development, the United States FBI launched the Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit to focus on cryptocurrency-related crimes. Similarly, the Department of Justice named the first director for its recently-established National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (US 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,079.18</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-486.99</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.41%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14,009.54</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-259.05</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.82%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,348.87</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-52.80</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.20%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major US stock indices appeared to be on the verge of an overall gain at midweek, only to end up negative after declining on Thursday and Friday. Indices fell by nearly 2%, with military tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border being the driving force. These geopolitical tensions added to the market's already high inflation and rising rate-hike expectations by the Fed. In addition, ​​the 10-year US Treasury yield climbed as high as 2.06% on Wednesday, 16 February 2022, the highest since July 2019, before falling back to around 1.93% on Friday, 18 February 2022. The factors contributing to this momentum were Russia's and the Fed's ambiguous signals, as well as economic reports.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the January economic reports, US retail sales increased from a December decline thanks to a surge in online sales and higher furniture sales, contributing to better than expected growth. Furthermore, high inflation also aided the latest monthly retail sales total, which was up by 3.8% compared to a 2.5% decline in December. On the other hand, the latest weekly total of new jobless claims surged to 248,000, the highest level in 4 weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the bright side, the Fed released minutes from the January FOMC meeting, which provided some comfort to markets since there were no major surprises or overly hawkish remarks. While the Fed was generally ready to raise rates in March, the minutes indicated that it did not favour a 0.50% rate hike or other aggressive moves. However, the committee did acknowledge that a significant reduction in the Fed's balance sheet looked prudent. Just 2 weeks ago, the market expectations for a 0.50% rate hike at the March meeting dropped from over 90% to around 33%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the key events to focus on would be on the Consumer Confidence Index and the Fed Monetary Policy Report (which is tentative).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading, and the Deriv X platform, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency trading is not available for clients residing within the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>","published_date":"2022-02-21"},{"id":"a2088b80-4d5b-4e76-8544-c99c1d78e312","main_image":{"id":"fd05cb56-40de-465d-80af-ea1d06ece3b0","description":"An Easy Guide on How to Buy Crypto on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/cac11/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/89239/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.jpg 150w,\n/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/2c227/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.jpg 300w,\n/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/cac11/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.jpg 600w,\n/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/751a4/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/49f80/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.webp 150w,\n/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/de298/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.webp 300w,\n/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/52493/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.webp 600w,\n/static/b08492deb90d8d1d262955684ae0ed92/1eb60/An%20easy%20guide%20on%20how%20to%20buy%20crypto%20on%20Deriv.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"an-easy-guide-on-how-to-buy-crypto-on-deriv","featured":false,"visibility":"hide_for_eu_uk","tags":[{"id":"150","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}},{"id":"151","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Payment methods"}}],"blog_title":"An easy guide on how to buy crypto on Deriv","blog_description":"Eager to jump on the crypto bandwagon?

Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the DXY Index was up by +0.71% (close over close). This rise followed the US inflation rate data for January (CPI), which came in at 7.5% and reports that Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine. With this rise and movements in other safe-haven assets like US Treasuries and the Japanese yen, the market may be becoming increasingly concerned about a potential invasion. At the time of writing, the dollar index is trading around $92.2 and, as per the monthly charts, has multiple support levels at 50 SMA, 100 SMA and 200 SMA around $95.93, $97.78 and $95.66, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the other pairs react?</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro depreciated, putting EUR/USD prices in jeopardy due to Russia and Ukraine's geopolitical uncertainties. A strong US inflation report, in which the CPI hit a new 40-year high in January, pushed the EUR/USD even lower. Therefore, the likelihood of a 50-basis-point rate hike by the Federal Reserve at its March meeting has risen dramatically.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD/JPY surged to just a point below its five-year high. With the release of the January inflation report, Treasury yields rose sharply, sending stocks tumbling and driving the USD/JPY to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&yen;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">116.34. In the United States, interest rates have resurfaced as a major factor. Furthermore, Japan's economic data was disappointing, with Labor Cash Earnings and Household Spending falling short of their respective predictions of 0.1% and 0.3% in December.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD pair managed to keep most of its gains from the previous week. As US inflation touched a new 40-year high, the spotlight switched back to the Federal Reserve's (Fed) tightening stance. Meanwhile, the UK economy has weathered the Omicron storm. However, due to Brexit concerns and failed attempts by the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) to relaunch the negotiations on post-Brexit commercial relations in Northern Ireland (NI), GBP bulls have been cautious. This sentiment caused the pair to trade in the range of $1.3485 &ndash; $1.3645, despite improving fundamentals.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the focus will be on the January Retail Sales &ndash; predicted to be at 1.8% MoM, the January Producer Price Index &ndash; expected to be at 0.5% MoM, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/88879dd4-b215-4811-a6ed-4f61c2c0d22b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/88879dd4-b215-4811-a6ed-4f61c2c0d22b\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" width=\"1684\" height=\"845\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil prices rose for the eighth consecutive week as tensions between Russia and Ukraine raised concerns about limited global supplies. The global benchmark, WTI crude, rose just shy of $95 a barrel on Friday 11 February 2022, before paring gains.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Russia's potential invasion of Ukraine poses a geopolitical risk that could disrupt global oil supplies and prompt US regulatory sanctions. In recent weeks, oil prices have risen due to speculation that demand will outpace supply as the global economy continues its recovery from the pandemic.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"The oil market is incredibly tight. Prices continue to surge and are now reaching levels that are uncomfortable for consumers across the world\", said Toril Bosoni, head of IEA's oil markets division, on Friday 11 February 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the metals market, gold ended last week at its highest level in 3 months after breaking through $1,850 &ndash; a crucial resistance level. In Friday's late session, the yellow metal caught demand as US involvement in the Russia-Ukraine crisis deepened. While the news induced selling pressures within the equity markets, gold prices were up more than 1% on the day and around 2.1% on the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold is currently trading at around $1,856 levels, well above its corresponding 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages. The latest geopolitical uncertainty, along with equity market instability and rising inflationary pressures across the US and Europe, is likely to ensure its place in traders' portfolios for the foreseeable future.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2f449726-e715-4e85-9a0c-c0f18a14d32c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2f449726-e715-4e85-9a0c-c0f18a14d32c\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" width=\"1681\" height=\"887\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thursday, 10 February 2022, saw the price of Bitcoin fall slightly amid a more severe financial pullback in the US. On Friday, 11 February 2022, US president Biden urged all Americans to leave Ukraine immediately, warning \"an invasion could begin at any time\". Furthermore, Russian and Ukrainian geopolitical risks contributed to the crypto dip and retreat to safe-haven assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin surrendered most of its gains from the week's opening as the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to over 2% for the first time since 2019. The world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency fell by almost 1.30% to around $44,100 levels.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent months Bitcoin has been trading noticeably similar to tech stocks. Last week, increasing inflation pressures pushed the 10-year benchmark higher, which negatively affected high-growth tech stocks and Bitcoin. This was because institutional traders are now interested in Bitcoin and trading it as a risk asset. As a result, the world's largest cryptocurrency has been trading negatively along with tech stocks, which started the new year on a sharp decline.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, Bitcoin is trading dangerously close to its first major support level of $41,943 at the 61.8% retracement level. If it slips through this level, the new primary support would be $40,627 at 50% retracement. Meanwhile, an upwards movement for Bitcoin would introduce $43,293 as its next resistance level at 76.4% retracement.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most altcoins followed Bitcoin's plunge, as Ethereum dropped by 4% on Friday, 11 February 2022, while Solana plummeted by 7%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analysts expect Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, to remain under pressure for the next few months. \"In last spring's drawdown, it took about 6 months for Bitcoin to recover. A similar timeline in the current drawdown would put a recovery date sometime in May\", wrote Bitcoin holding company NYDIG last week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (US 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,738.06</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-353.07</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.01%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14,253.84</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-317.41</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,418.64</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-65.23</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.45%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major US market indices fell again this week, continuing with their poor start to the year. Due to increased concerns about inflation, monetary tightening, and the geopolitical turmoil in Ukraine, stocks rose on Tuesday and Wednesday before falling on Thursday and Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 10-year US Treasury yield rose above 2% for the first time since mid-2019 for the third week in a row due to inflation fears. This rise caused rate-sensitive sectors, such as growth companies, to suffer as more aggressive Fed tightening expectations increased.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock and bond prices plummeted after the government reported 7.5% inflation in January &ndash; the highest since 1982. It was more than the 7.0% increase in December and much higher than the 1.8% annual average of inflation in 2019.

Here is everything you need to know about it, including its unique characteristics and security features.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MetaTrader 5, also known as MT5, is one of the most versatile trading platforms on the market, equipped with various features to improve your trading experience.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the top features you need to know.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launched in 2010, MT5 has been specifically designed with the retail trader and the smaller institutional traders in mind. It gained huge traction in the market very quickly, primarily due to its true multi-asset capabilities. It allows traders to trade derivative instruments (including CFDs) on forex, stocks and stock indices, cryptocurrencies, and exchange-traded commodities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its multi-device operability, user-friendly interface, and robust tools for fundamental and technical analysis have also significantly contributed to its popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, the key features of MT5 are what set it apart from other platforms and take the trading experience to the next level. Here's what the platform has to offer.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Algorithmic trading and backtesting capabilities</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MT5 is built on MQL5, a high performance and object-oriented programming language. With this, traders get improved backtesting capabilities, including multiple pair backtesting. The language can also be used for developing trading robots and algorithms.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithmic trading on the MT5 platform has freed up traders' time and energy for more important activities, such as monitoring the markets and identifying opportunities. Now, all they need to do is set up the parameters for entering and exiting trades, and the platform takes care of the rest. Traders get notifications when positions are opened and closed so that they can stay in touch with their trading, even on the go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This versatile programming language also lets traders create technical indicators with special characteristics. Access to a wide range of free indicators is provided by the MQL5 codebase, while the Marketplace allows traders to shop for their preferred indicators and Expert Advisors (EAs). So, traders don&rsquo;t need to be programming experts to capitalise on these functionalities.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Wide range of technical indicators</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the MT5 platform, traders can access 44 analytical objects, 38 technical indicators, and numerous charts in 21 timeframes. These tools can be customised according to the trading strategy in terms of settings and analytical parameters. There is also the option of adding indicators to the chart itself or a separate sub-window. Plus, traders can choose to add one indicator over another.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also choices for variations in timeframes, allowing traders to study market volume and price momentum from different angles. Traders also have access to both tick volume data, and real volume traded data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4abf30a4-52b4-4c03-bdff-8c5341c72490\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4abf30a4-52b4-4c03-bdff-8c5341c72490\" alt=\"Technical Indicators on The Deriv MT5 Platform\" width=\"690\" height=\"360\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<h2><strong>One-click trading</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders have a highly flexible trading experience on the MT5 platform with the help of market orders, 6 different types of pending order, and also stop-loss and take-profit orders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, it offers the &ldquo;one-click trading&rdquo; option, which reduces trade execution time. With this feature, traders can complete many different operations, including modifying orders, entering positions, and setting stop loss levels with just a single click. The feature can be used across all execution modes.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Economic calendar</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MT5 platform allows traders to gain real-time insights into financial developments posted by reputed international news agencies. Traders can access multiple newsletters about global events and analysts' predictions daily. Additionally, the platform has a built-in economic calendar, which offers the time, date, description, and degree of importance of macroeconomic data releases. These help traders evaluate underlying market trends and predict the price movements of assets.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0caea9a3-d6b5-4611-9137-f27cf49999b4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0caea9a3-d6b5-4611-9137-f27cf49999b4\" alt=\"Economic Calendar on The Deriv M T5 Platform \" width=\"656\" height=\"271\" /></span></a></p>\n<h2><strong>Comprehensive security</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robust security measures are vital for any trading platform, and MT5's security features are among the best available.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data exchanged between the server and the trading platform is compressed and encrypted using a 128-bit system.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform has an extended authentication mode as well. It can be enabled on the server and provides added protection against unauthorised access.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the authentication process, the identity of clients is not the only thing that is verified. The trade server also has to undergo authentication.

This ensures that it is almost impossible to connect to a trade server with configuration files copied from the /config folder of a different platform.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MT5 is a truly versatile platform suitable for both new and more experienced traders.

Check out the benefits of forex trading and see why you should start trading the biggest financial market in the world too.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is not only the biggest financial market in the world, it is also one of the most accessible markets to trade on. This marketplace is made up of buyers and sellers from all over the world participating in </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forex live trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and offers opportunities suitable for both beginner and experienced traders.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;ve been thinking about whether to add forex to your trading portfolio, read on to find out why you should.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade 24/5&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is open round the clock on weekdays, giving you even more opportunities to trade international currency pairs and take advantage of their price movements. Thanks to the business hours of forex exchanges across international time zones, at least one region is operating at any point during the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The four major exchanges around the world that start and end the trading day are Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York &mdash; with these exchanges, forex trading starts at 9:00 pm (GMT) on Sunday and ends at 9:00 pm (GMT) on Friday.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gain exposure to global economic markets&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade forex, you&rsquo;re able to gain international exposure to different global markets depending on the currency pair or basket you trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex currency pairs are categorised into major, minor, and exotic pairs, and are made up of currencies from all over the world. These three categories have different liquidity levels that represent how actively traded the currency pairs are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also trade currency basket indices. These indices measure the value of one currency against a basket of five other equally weighted global currencies, increasing your exposure to even more global markets at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade a highly liquid market</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquidity refers to how quickly an asset can be bought and sold. When a market is highly liquid, it basically means that there are lots of buyers and sellers trading at any point, leading to a higher trading volume and lower transaction costs as traders seek to complete transactions easily and quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The forex market is one of the most liquid in the world, with over 6 trillion USD traded daily. With the large number of active trades happening every day and low costs, it becomes easier for traders to enter the forex market and start trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Profit from both rising and falling prices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade forex via options, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFDs (contract for differences)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and multipliers, which all allow you to potentially profit from rising as well as falling prices. With these trade types, you&rsquo;ll be predicting the price movements of currency pairs or baskets, and if the price moves according to your prediction, you&rsquo;ll earn a profit.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trades are timed, so you&rsquo;ll be predicting market movements within a specific time period. On the other hand, CFDs trades can stay open for as long as you want to take advantage of market movements (as long as you have sufficient funds in your account to cover potential losses in case the market moves against you). With multipliers, you&rsquo;ll get to multiply your potential profits without losing more than your stake.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start trading with low capital requirement</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to the highly liquid nature of the forex market and low transaction costs, you can open a forex trade even with relatively low capital. On Deriv, all you need is a 5 USD deposit into your account, and you can start trading forex on any of Deriv&rsquo;s platforms.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the most of high leverage</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade major, minor, and exotic currencies with high leverage. Trading with leverage gives you more market exposure by allowing you to trade more than your capital allows. This means that you get to open a trade that&rsquo;s worth more than your stake. For example, with a leverage of 1:10 and a stake amount of 100 USD, you&rsquo;ll get to open a trade that&rsquo;s actually worth 1,000 USD.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The profit or loss you make at the end of your trade is based on the trade&rsquo;s full value, so trading with leverage allows you to maximise your capital and increase your potential profits. However, do note that this also means that potential losses are also increased.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of tight spreads</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spread is the difference between the bid and ask prices, and represents the cost to open a CFD trade. These are determined by the broker and are calculated in pips, which are small price movements of an asset.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv offers one of the tightest competitive spreads in the industry, with spreads as low as 0.5 pips. In a highly liquid market like forex where there&rsquo;s a high trading volume and transactions are completed quickly, the tighter the spread, the faster you are likely to gain back your capital and take greater advantage from the price changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- - -</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out more about options trading and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Deriv before you get started.

However, it bounced back on Friday, 4 February 2022, following data showing the world's largest economy created far more jobs than expected. The same data suggests the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates by a larger amount at its March policy meeting. Despite its bounce back, the US Dollar Index was still down by 1.09% (close over close) for the week. As per the monthly charts, the US Dollar Index ended its week at around $95.48 and showed a 50 SMA support level at $95.34 and multiple resistance levels of 100 SMA and 200 SMA around $95.63 and $96.03, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the other pairs react?</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUR/USD pair had its best week since March 2020, gaining around 350 pips to reach a new 2022 high of $1.148, and is now trading at around $1.144. Following the European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting, the shared currency rose as President Christine Lagarde startled market participants with her hawkish tone, despite the delivery of a modestly dovish statement.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast, US data for the week showed a -301k change in ADP Employment compared to the 207k that was forecasted, while Non-Farm Payrolls added 467k jobs, which was 3 times more than predicted. The unemployment rate increased to 4%; however, the participation rate increased to 62.2%, indicating a healthy recovery in the employment sector.</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD has had a mixed week due to the Bank of England's (BoE) varying signals and Non-Farm Payrolls. As expected, the BoE announced a 25 basis point rate hike, but 4 of the 9 members opted for a 50 basis point increase instead. As a result of this close call, Sterling rose, despite November's unexpected no-hike decision.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, speculation about double the hike in rates also roiled the US dollar. Federal Reserve officials downplayed the possibility of a 50 basis point hike in borrowing costs when the bank meets in March, as opposed to comments made by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who hinted at the potential of such a move. This same message was repeated by 6 authorities, putting pressure on the US dollar.</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the release of the US employment report, which showed better-than-expected numbers, the USD/JPY jumped from &yen;114.90 to &yen;115.38.

On Thursday, 3 February 2022, rising US Treasury bond yields restrained gold's upside, while a strong US January jobs report couldn't help the pair gain bullish momentum. Gold ended the week at around $1,808. The RSI for 14 days on a 6-month chart is about 48 and is near the 200 SMA of $1,806 and above the 100 SMA of $1,797.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As traders anticipate the release of the US January Consumer Price Index (CPI) this week, gold is expected to be inversely correlated with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield. In particular, the January Consumer Price Index could influence expectations for a 50 basis point (bps) Fed rate hike in March.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil prices soared for the first time since 2014, surpassing the $90 per barrel mark, which drove the prices to seven-year highs and posted a seventh successive week of gains. WTI was up by 4.72% (close over close) for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil prices continued to rise due to factors such as a temperature drop caused by the winter storm that hit the US recently and geopolitical tensions between the US, Ukraine, and Russia. Recent statistics indicated Iraqi output in January was considerably below its allowed quota under the previous OPEC+ arrangement. Furthermore, market commentators suggested Kazakhstan wants to keep more of its supply at home to cut domestic prices and ease civil tensions.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/571f9f62-585f-4b48-bdcc-9f3ea0d41d30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/571f9f62-585f-4b48-bdcc-9f3ea0d41d30\" alt=\"Cryptocurrency chart on Deriv\" width=\"2262\" height=\"1134\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg Click to view full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a turbulent week across global markets, Bitcoin rose the most in 4 months as traders showed signs of renewed risk appetite.

Technically speaking, Bitcoin is currently trading at around $41,600, above the 76.4% retracement level at $40,900, followed by the next support level of the 61.8% retracement level at around $39,400.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, the price of Ether rose by 12%. Even SOL, the native currency of the Solana blockchain, posted similar gains. After hours of being lost to what some call the largest DeFi hack, the crypto was restored and increased by roughly 12%. Following suit, Polkadot rose 15.3%, bringing its seven-day gain to 20%, Terra was up 11.53% at the same period, and BNB, XRP, and Cardano all climbed 9-12%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of market capitalisation, Dogecoin was up by 5.5%, while Avalanche was up by 14.5%.

This market is commonly known as forex or FX, and it is the world&rsquo;s biggest and most popular market, with over 5 trillion USD worth of trades placed every day.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although forex trading happens mostly online on different trading platforms, you&rsquo;ve most likely made a face-to-face forex transaction a few times in your life too. For example, when you travel to another country, say the United States, you need to convert your home country&rsquo;s currency into USD. When you do this, the exchange rate between the two currencies determines the amount in USD you get for your local currency. The exchange rate fluctuates continuously and is based on the supply and demand of the currencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple terms, forex trading means buying one currency and selling another at the same time; this is why you always see them quoted in pairs. For example, EUR/USD and GBP/USD. The first currency in the pair is the one you are buying, and the second is the one you are selling.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which currencies can I trade live on forex on Deriv?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forex live trading, just like the offline version of it, involves trading on currency pairs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three types of currency pairs:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Major pairs &mdash; the world's most widely traded currencies paired, e.g. GBP/USD or EUR/GBP</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minor pairs &mdash; less liquid currency pairs, e.g. NZD/USD or AUD/CAD</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exotic pairs &mdash; one major currency paired with an emerging economy's currency, e.g. EUR/HKD</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Forex pairs available for live trading on Deriv:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/279982a8-fc88-4a30-ae6b-901e4ddeb467\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/279982a8-fc88-4a30-ae6b-901e4ddeb467\" alt=\"Forex Pairs Available for Live Trading on Deriv (old)\" width=\"603\" height=\"542\" /></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to get started with forex live trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple ways to start </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">forex live trading</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

But whichever trading type you choose, there are some universal tips that will help you make the beginning of your forex trading journey a little easier:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Familiarise yourself with forex lingo</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Base currency:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The currency you are holding. If you&rsquo;re from France, that currency would be Euro. In the EUR/USD pair, EUR is the base currency, and it shows how much US dollars you can buy with one Euro.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Quote currency:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The currency used as a reference to measure the value of the base currency. In the EUR/USD pair, USD is the quote currency.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Bid price: </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bid price is what the broker is willing to pay for the base currency.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Ask price:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The ask price is the rate at which a broker will sell the quote currency. It is always higher than the bid price.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Spread</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The difference between the ask price and the bid price; Ask price - Bid price = Spread.</span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are buying the currency, you&rsquo;ll pay the ask price, and if you are selling it, you&rsquo;ll receive the bid price.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Analyse the market&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From major political events, elections, and an increase in government debt to something as unexpected as natural disasters, there are many factors that may affect how the forex market moves. That&rsquo;s why it is crucial to keep an eye on market-related news and significant events that might affect the price movement. Good analytical skills and in-depth knowledge about the market conditions will help you to make the best possible trading decisions.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Choose the right broker</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading forex live with a reputable and internationally regulated broker can mean the difference between profiting from your trades and losing money. It&rsquo;s crucial to take your time to do some research and read reviews in order to select the broker that best suits your needs. Here is what you need to pay attention to. Your broker:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offers demo accounts where you can practise trading risk free.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Has a wide suite of available forex pairs and other trading products to help you diversify your portfolio.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gives you easy and round-the-clock access to their customer support team to provide you with quality assistance whenever you need it.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offers a wide selection of deposit and withdrawal options in your country of residence to make sure you can fund your account and take your money out of it effortlessly.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Has the required licences and complies with the necessary regulations in your country of residence.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Practice, practice, practice</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make use of your demo account! The idea behind demo accounts is not only to offer you an opportunity to get to know the online trading interface. Having a demo account also allows you to test your trading skills and strategies with virtual money without putting any of your hard-earned capital at risk. Once you feel confident in your understanding of the market and the broker&rsquo;s trading platform, you are more likely to succeed in trading with a real account.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need more info before diving in?

For the first time since July 2020, the Dollar Index (DXY) surpassed $97 by more than 1.7% as the Federal Reserve announced it would raise rates faster in the months ahead. Technically speaking, the monthly chart shows multiple support levels of 200 and 100 SMAs around $96.6 and $97.1, respectively, and a 50 SMA resistance level at around $97.2.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How did the other pairs react?</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EUR/USD pair was trading near $1.11 and slumped to its weakest level since May 2020 after the Federal Reserve confirmed its hawkish view.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD was barely around $1.3400 due to mixed US data and the endorsement of the rate hikes made by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, political uncertainty surrounding Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also weighed on the British Pound.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD/JPY had an upward bias before it slid ahead of the weekend due to the US 10-year Treasury yield fall by 8 basis points from 1.85% to 1.77%.

On Wednesday, 26 January 2022, the Fed announced that its policy settings would remain unchanged and that the quantitative easing program would end as scheduled in early March. However, during the Federal Open Market Committee press conference, Chairman Jerome Powell's comments on the policy outlook sparked a rally in the USD and sent XAU/USD down sharply.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the XAU/USD pair reached its highest level since November on Wednesday, 26 January 2022, at $1,853, it lost more than 3% from that level to end the week below $1,800. As far as technical analysis is concerned, gold is trading below the 50% retracement level near $1796.93. The metal's next support level will be near the 38.2% retracement level at around $1780.27.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, silver had its worst week of the year, dropping for 6 consecutive days, closing at approximately $22.39.

Compared to its all-time high of $69,000 hit in November, Bitcoin has fallen by nearly 20% since the start of 2022.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent weeks, the prices of cryptocurrencies have been under severe pressure. Traders have been worried about the ripple effect of expected Federal Reserve interest rate increases that have caused digital tokens and stocks to fall together since the beginning of the year. Last week, the Fed held interest rates near zero, aiming to increase rates to combat inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, on Thursday, 27 January 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission denied a proposal to list and trade shares of Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust. When making its decision, the SEC cited trader protection and public interest concerns. Since last year, traders have been able to buy shares of an ETF that tracks Bitcoin futures contracts. However, a spot Bitcoin ETF would track the price of Bitcoin rather than the price of Bitcoin futures, and the SEC isn't quite ready for that yet.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $37,200, right under its 38.2% retracement level of $37,400. If it breaches this level, the new resistance at 50% retracement level will be $38,700.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum's has been in a slump since its price dropped below $3,000 on 20 January 2022. Currently, the price is trading at $2,500, but on Monday, 24 January 2022, it fell below $2,200 &ndash; its lowest level since July 2021.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) has climbed to ninth place by market capitalisation even though its price has slid more than 4% in the past 24 hours. The top meme cryptocurrency has managed to topple the embattled Terra (LUNA) token, which is down by another 10% amid a brutal sell-off.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices<br /><br /></strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (US 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34,725.47</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">360.97</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">+1.05%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14,454.61</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-54.97</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,431.85</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">+21.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">+0.49%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 28 January 2022, equity markets surged to reverse previous mid-week losses as traders witnessed another volatile week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.05%, while the S&amp;P 500 index ended a three-week losing streak by gaining 0.49%. However, the Nasdaq 100 ended with barely a change of -0.38% for the week.<br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on Thursday's closing prices, the S&amp;P 500 was on track to post a weekly loss of about 1.90%. As January comes to a close, the S&amp;P 500 is paced for its worst monthly performance since March 2020, trading down by 7%. Furthermore, the Dow Jones could also witness its worst month since October 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latest economic data was the focus on Friday, 28 January 2022. In December, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index rose by 5.8% year-over-year &ndash; the highest level since 1982. Out of this 5.8%, the core PCE, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, rose at a 4.9% annual rate. Over the past month, all 3 major indices have fallen as traders consider the consequences of the Federal Reserve's more hawkish monetary policy tilt. With traders digesting the Federal Reserve's pivot to tighter policy, the CBOE Volatility Index, used as the market's fear gauge, shot up to a yearly high of above 30.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this, Apple (AAPL) posted record earnings and better-than-expected profits, tech stocks led Friday's rally. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT) surpassed earnings expectations by posting revenues of $51.73bn versus forecasts of $50.88bn.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stated earlier this week that interest rates would be raised in March above near-zero levels.

It's where stock trading &mdash; the buying and selling of shares in a particular company &mdash; takes place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a first step to understanding how the stock market and stock trading work, let's first answer the question, 'What are stocks?'</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defining stocks</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stock, also known as equity, is a type of investment that represents a share or partial ownership of a company. If you buy stocks in a corporation, you become a shareholder, and you get a dividend of the corporation&rsquo;s profits based on the amount of stock you own. Dividends may be paid in cash or in more stock.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corporations sell stocks to raise capital for operating their businesses. A stock market exchange is where these public corporations sell their stocks. Stocks are generally expected to appreciate in value over time, especially if the company has shown continuous growth and stability. This is the main reason why investors buy stocks &mdash; to build their wealth.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever a company's stock value rises, stockholders can sell the stock they previously purchased, at a profit. And, essentially, this is how stock trading works.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0c76b40c-4491-47d0-b756-c1ead5b08223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0c76b40c-4491-47d0-b756-c1ead5b08223\" alt=\"Different stocks available to trade.\" width=\"1650\" height=\"1116\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock trading takes place in the stock market. The stock market acts as a commercial hub for purchases of stocks and mutual funds. It&rsquo;s open to everyone, which means you get to be among other people who invest in the stock market. How it operates is pretty straightforward &mdash; it lets buyers and sellers negotiate prices and make trades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market works through a network of exchanges like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, for example. It is in these exchanges that companies list shares of their stocks that can be bought.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The value of each stock is highly dependent on its supply and demand. As the laws of supply and demand dictate, if there are more buyers (demand) than sellers (supply) for a specific stock, the value of that stock will go up.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If more sellers are active in the market than buyers, the stock&rsquo;s value will decrease.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the dependence on supply and demand, it&rsquo;s logical to conclude that the stock market is highly volatile. As with any volatile market, trading on the stock market has its risks. One way to work around the risks is to spend time researching which stocks to trade in and when to trade them.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading CFDs on stocks</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the market's volatility, trading in the stock market comes with risks that can make you hesitant to start. If you want to learn the ropes without jumping in head-first, you can try trading CFDs on stocks first.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFD trading</a>, you can trade on the price movement of any financial market without actually owning the underlying asset. Traders predict whether a particular asset's price will rise or fall.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think the asset price will go up, you can buy a CFD and gain a profit from the rise. This is called &lsquo;going long&rsquo;. If you think the price of an underlying asset will go down, you can sell a CFD and profit from the fall. This is called &lsquo;going short&rsquo;.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more the market moves in your favour, the more profit you make. But, it&rsquo;s also possible that your predictions may move against you, which would result in potential loss.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where to trade CFDs on stocks</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you have the option to choose from two reliable platforms where you can trade CFDs on stocks &mdash; Deriv X, and Deriv MT5 (DMT5).</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0d930fe9-09a0-4948-8549-8d558b075193\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0d930fe9-09a0-4948-8549-8d558b075193\" alt=\"Deriv X with an active trade on stocks.\" width=\"2012\" height=\"1116\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=introducing-deriv-x-%E2%80%93-the-highly-customisable-cfd-trading-platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv X</a> is a multi-asset trading platform that offers CFDs on stocks and other assets, including <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forex</a>, commodities, <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cryptocurrency\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptocurrencies</a>, and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/an-introduction-to-synthetic-indices-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">synthetic indices</a>.

Despite this advance, the index remains within the range seen in January, and now the focus turns to next week's Federal Reserve interest rate announcement, and the broader rally for 2021 is at stake.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&rsquo;s how our top pairs responded to this gain:</span></p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">USD/JPY is approaching its monthly low of &yen;113.38 amid the decline in global equity markets. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision could change the outlook for the currency in the near future as it prepares for a normalised monetary policy. The US monetary policy decisions may support USD/JPY since the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates over the next few months, while also explaining its exit strategy.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After recent gains, EUR/USD seems to have returned to its comfort zone &ndash; just a few pips above the $1.1300 mark. On Tuesday, 18 January 2022, the pair fell the most as US traders returned to their desks and pushed government bond yields to a level not seen since February 2020.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having won four weeks in a row, GBP/USD lost nearly 1% last week following Friday's disappointing retail sales data that caused the British pound to continue losing interest. The US dollar struggled against falling US Treasury bond yields, however, risk-averse market conditions weighed on the pound ahead of the weekend.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/JPY pair maintained its downwards trend, falling to a three-week low around the &yen;154.45 level during the Asian session.

However, the Federal Open Market Committee&rsquo;s (FOMC) rate decision is scheduled for Wednesday, 26 January 2022. Traders are hoping for clearer hints about upcoming rate hikes, and are pricing in a first-rate hike for March 2022 along with at least 3 hikes through the year.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/25920bf5-b5af-40ca-833c-5277b01c4080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/25920bf5-b5af-40ca-833c-5277b01c4080\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv\" width=\"1246\" height=\"636\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

By Thursday afternoon, spot gold was trading at $1,841 per ounce. Aside from gold, silver rose 2.1% to $24.63 per ounce last week, whilst platinum and palladium extended gains from their previous rallies.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, gold's primary support level is $1,765 at a retracement of 23.6%. The yellow metal is continuing with its upward momentum and has already broken through its first major resistance around $1,824. Meanwhile, its new resistance level sits at $1,765 at the 50% retracement level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"With all indicators pointing to inflation continuing to be problematic and crude oil prices remaining high, gold prices could hit $2,000 an ounce this year,\" said Jim Wyckoff, Senior Market Analyst at Kitco News.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the US dollar index levelling off and inflation still the centre of discussion, gold is seeing an unexpected rally as traders flock towards safe-haven assets whilst crypto and high-risk tech take the hit.

Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the cryptocurrency market suffered heavy losses as the US stock market declined sharply. Wall Street suffered a poor performance last Thursday, 20 January 2022, which led to a sell-off that wiped out almost $150 billion from the crypto market. With the Federal Reserve also indicating plans to reduce its balance sheet and raise interest rates, traders seemingly responded by shedding their positions in riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, reputed for their high risk-high volatility, were included in the list. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin fell by 15% on the week and was trading around the $36,000 mark by late Friday afternoon. The world's leading cryptocurrency was trading down almost 50% from its previous record high of $69,000 last November. Meanwhile, Ethereum dropped by more than 20%, trading close to $2,500.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently trading around $35,500, Bitcoin may find support around its first support level of $30,750 at 38.2% retracement. On the upside, Bitcoin's primary resistance level lies at $37,250 at 50% retracement. If this level is broken, its secondary resistance level of $43,700 would be activated.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin's overall growth can be attributed to its use as a hedge against inflation caused by the US government's $2 trillion Covid stimulus package. However, with inflation now at its highest yearly pace in 4 decades, analysts believe that the risks of a more hawkish Federal Reserve will weigh down on Bitcoin's growth during this period.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's important to note that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> regulators are also clamping down on cryptocurrencies, with China banning all crypto-related activities and US policymakers implementing restrictions on certain market aspects. Naturally, this poses an even larger threat to the long-term growth of decentralised digital currencies.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>US Indices<br /><br /></strong></h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (US 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">34265.37</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1103.10</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.12%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">14438.40</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-772.36</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-5.08%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4397.94</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-179.17</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.91%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US Indices have continued to slump 3 weeks in a row due to fears of rising interest rates and their impact on growth sectors.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the interest rate environment has changed, the stock market leaders have been shifting as the weak performance of the technology sector has caused the indices to fall.

So a sell order in this case means that you predict the downward price movement, but you don&rsquo;t actually sell an asset.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2c40751c-9604-4d49-8852-98aadb9f9b6f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2c40751c-9604-4d49-8852-98aadb9f9b6f\" alt=\"Going Short in Cfd Trading\" width=\"608\" height=\"390\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference between the price when you open your position and the price when you close it will be your profit. The more the market moves in the anticipated direction, the more profit you make. However, if the market moves in the opposite direction from your prediction, this price difference will become your loss.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the margin in CFD trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you buy a CFD, you don't have to pay the full value of the position. In fact, you make a refundable deposit to cover only a fraction of the trade value, and we cover the rest of the trade. This amount is also known as margin, and it will be returned to your account should the trade be successful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This practice is called trading on margin or leveraged trading. It allows traders to open bigger positions with smaller initial capital and amplify the potential profit. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that potential loss is also multiplied.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s see how it works. For example, let&rsquo;s assume one stock of Apple currently costs 10 USD. You think the price will go up and buy 100 CFDs on Apple stock. The broker you are trading with has a set margin rate of 10%. It means you only need to pay 10% of the total value of the trade to open it &ndash; this is your position margin.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how it&rsquo;s calculated:</span></p>\n<p><strong>10 USD &times; 100 CFDs = 1,000 USD</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Total trade value = the price of 1 CFD &times; the number of CFDs you are buying</span></p>\n<p><strong>10% &times; $1,000 = $100</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Position margin = margin rate &times; total trade value</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your prediction is correct and the price of one Apple stock moves up to 15 USD, the new total value of your trade will be:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><strong>100 CFDs &times; 15 USD = 1,500 USD</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may decide to close your trade at this point and take your profit. In this case, your initial trade amount was only 100 USD, but your profit will be:</span></p>\n<p><strong>1,500  USD &ndash;  1,000 USD = 500 USD</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, keep in mind that if your prediction is incorrect and the Apple stock price drops to 5 USD, your loss will also be 500 USD, which is also more than your initial stake.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s crucial to learn </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/beginners-guide-the-dos-and-don-ts-of-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading basics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and hone your skills before jumping into real-world trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to see how margin works in practice?

First, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) dived 6.6% after the firm posted underwhelming 4th quarter revenues and absorbed the additional costs of rising compensation expenses. Similarly, Citigroup (C) shares reversed after experiencing a similar miss on trading revenues during the 4th quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk-averse sentiment also increased due to disappointing data releases such as the December retail sales in the US, which fell by 1.9% MoM, marking its most significant drop since February 2021.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, traders are also worried about ongoing price pressure across the US economy.

The US dollar Index rose by approximately 0.25% in the last hour, sitting at $95.05. This rise was spurred by the rise in yields on US 10-year Treasury bonds, up to 1.75%, a three basis point gain.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, GBP/USD is trading at $1.36800, which lies between 61.8% retracement support at $1.36300 and 78.6% retracement resistance at $1.37500.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In relation to the Japanese yen, the US currency fell 0.02% to more than a three-week low of &yen;114.150. The safe-haven Japanese currency has benefited from the recent souring of risk sentiment in global financial markets. Plus, policymakers at the Bank of Japan are also debating when they can start telegraphing an eventual rate hike, which could happen before inflation reaches the bank's target of 2%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically speaking, USD/JPY is currently trading at the &yen;114.300 level, right below its 50% retracement level of &yen;114.450.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/25022d3a-299b-4716-87a1-6b41b6be414c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/25022d3a-299b-4716-87a1-6b41b6be414c\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" width=\"3360\" height=\"1720\" /></a><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Another contributing factor was the Consumer Price Index, published on Wednesday, 12 January 2022, which rose by 7% YoY in December. Overall, gold started its week at around $1,800 and ended at around $1,817.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technically, gold is trading near its resistance, around $1,835 at the 61.8% retracement level. If it does breach the resistance, the new resistance would be at around the $1,890 mark at the 78.6% retracement level.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will not feature any high-tier data; however, traders will closely observe the bond yield. If the 10-year US Treasury yield falls below 1.7% and stays there, the US dollar will face new selling pressure, and gold could rise. Conversely, a break above 1.8% would put pressure on gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil has continued its bullish momentum as the US dollar weakened and headed towards its most significant weekly fall in 4 months. Generally, a weaker US dollar makes the price of commodities more affordable for traders in other currencies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, oil prices reached a multi-year high, with demand outweighing supply and signs that the Omicron variant is not as disruptive as anticipated. WTI rose by around 6% last week, whereas Brent rose by about 5% last week. Meanwhile, China aims to release oil reserves during the Lunar New Year holidays as a strategic plan alongside the United States to curb the global prices of oil.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f0c26e96-53ff-470c-9958-6bc2e4361a7e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f0c26e96-53ff-470c-9958-6bc2e4361a7e\" alt=\"XBT/USD Chart on Deriv\" width=\"3360\" height=\"1720\" /></a><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Having payments handled between people without any involvement of a third party (like banks) is entirely different from how we used to deal with money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency isn&rsquo;t issued by any government; it uses a technology called blockchain that keeps records of all transactions within a decentralised global network of computers.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The data verifying these transactions is cryptographically encoded, which means one party transforms it into a code in a way that only the intended party can decode it and view, and that&rsquo;s where the &ldquo;crypto&rdquo; part comes from.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is cryptocurrency mining?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mining is a process of verifying cryptocurrency transactions. Miners encrypt every transaction and collect them together in groups that are called blocks. These blocks are later chained together, and that&rsquo;s what is called the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a block is fully verified and added to the blockchain, it generates new coins. As a result, a miner is rewarded with newly generated coins and transaction fees that are paid for all the transactions in a block. It's a&nbsp; way of earning crypto without buying it, and the most appealing reason to become a miner.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is cryptocurrency secure?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The complexity of blockchain technology makes cryptocurrencies highly resistant to hacking.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, it&rsquo;s decentralised &ndash; the data is shared with the entire network instead of being kept in one place, making it harder for hackers to find the source.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And most importantly, having all the transactions and internal information cryptographically secure makes it almost impossible to access or change the data</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why trade crypto?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we know how cryptocurrency works, let&rsquo;s find out how you can trade it. But first of all, why is crypto trading such a hot topic? More and more traders get involved in crypto trading daily for different reasons. It may be just a curiosity for some of them, but there are also undeniable benefits in it too:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Round the clock trading.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High volatility &ndash; prices change rapidly, giving traders a range of opportunities, not eliminating the risk, of course.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High liquidity, which makes it very easy to convert the most popular cryptocurrencies into cash.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s see how you can take advantage of these benefits.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where do beginners start with cryptocurrency trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The starting point depends on the type of trading you choose. The first option is to own the cryptocurrency you are going to trade. In this case, you need to exchange fiat money for the cryptocurrency of your choice on an exchange platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with it, you need to create a digital wallet to keep your cryptocurrency safe. It basically means just creating an account on a website or app. There are plenty of options available on the market. It&rsquo;s always a good idea to compare a few options to figure out what works better for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the wallets serve as exchange services too, to make this process easier. It means you can buy, sell and hold your cryptocurrency in the same place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other way to trade cryptocurrency is to speculate on its price movement without buying it. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of trading can be done with M</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultipliers </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or CFDs. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check the </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/cryptocurrency-trading-for-beginners-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency trading for beginners</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog to find out more about how you can trade crypto with these trade types.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which cryptocurrency should you choose for trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of February 2022, there are around 10,000 cryptocurrencies listed. Most cryptocurrency trading platforms offer quite a few options to choose from.

Growth sectors such as the technology and the discretionary sectors did not perform up to par, while value sectors such as energies and financial services sectors held up for the week. Furthermore, Mega cap technology stocks like Netflix, Microsoft, and Alphabet were down between 6% to 10% last week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This happened mainly due to the rise in Treasury yields, which was driven by the hawkish comments released from the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, 5 January 2022, suggesting a more positive outlook for further rate hikes and asset tapering. As a result, the 10-year Treasury yield went up from 1.34% last December to around 1.80% last week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The economic data released last week was mixed with the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) data for both manufacturing and service sectors missing its mark. The Non-Farm payrolls fell short of its expected target of 400,000 newly created jobs. Meanwhile, the average hourly earnings rose to 0.6% in December, beating the estimate of 0.4%. This contradictory data suggested that many Americans preferred self-employment, given that 4.5 million people quit their jobs in November 2021.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Highlights for this week include Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's nomination hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, in which he will be expected to offer more information about his hawkish comments last week. In addition to this, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index reports are scheduled for the week. Economists expect another hot month for both the readings, whereas few believe that inflation may have peaked, with November's CPI reading being the highest since 1982. Traders will also continue to keep an eye on the yields as Tech and Growth stocks are most sensitive to the rising yields.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9b115914-2b3a-4b83-a651-9b16e5479511\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9b115914-2b3a-4b83-a651-9b16e5479511\" alt=\"GBP/USD Chart on Deriv\" width=\"3104\" height=\"1624\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was a heavy week for the crypto markets, as Bitcoin's value plummeted to a 3-month low over worries about tightening monetary policy in the United States and an internet outage in Kazakhstan, the world's second-largest mining hub.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of late afternoon on Friday, 7 January 2022, Bitcoin's price was trading near the low of $41,360 after falling below the $42,000 mark. Bitcoin began its bearish run early last week upon hints from the Federal Reserve that policymakers were ready to aggressively dial back the stimulus aid that kept the economy afloat during the pandemic's peak.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hawkish attitude by monetary policymakers led to a global sell-off in equity markets, which spread over to cryptocurrencies. Even though supporters often describe Bitcoin as uncorrelated with traditional financial markets, experts have noted growing patterns between the price movements of bitcoin and stocks. The world's largest cryptocurrency could test the waters around the $38,600 level, where its first support level lies at the 23.6% retracement level. If Bitcoin bulls rally, upside resistance is visible around $44,400 at the 38.2% retracement level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altcoins also followed the price drop of the market leader, with Ethereum and Solana continuing to slide. This decline resulted in both coins shedding between 6-8% during Friday's sell-off.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading, and the Deriv X platform, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency trading is not available for clients residing within the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>","published_date":"2022-01-10"},{"id":"78d94774-a5fb-4ffd-aff9-c9b35f42adf9","main_image":{"id":"acf26dad-b197-4f22-9ae2-72745281904e","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/cac11/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.jpg","srcSet":"/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/89239/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.jpg 150w,\n/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/2c227/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.jpg 300w,\n/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/cac11/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.jpg 600w,\n/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/751a4/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/49f80/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.webp 150w,\n/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/de298/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.webp 300w,\n/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/52493/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.webp 600w,\n/static/401d8a34399c6b209f371e175ba18faf/1eb60/An%20introduction%20to%20synthetic%20indices%20trading.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"an-introduction-to-synthetic-indices-trading","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"74","tags_id":{"tag_name":"CFDs"}},{"id":"75","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Synthetic indices"}}],"blog_title":"An introduction to synthetic indices trading","blog_description":"In this introduction to synthetic indices trading, learn what synthetic indices are and which platforms you can trade them on.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On January 15, 2015, the Swiss National Bank announced its decision to cancel its 1.20 peg against the euro, a move that sent ripples across the globe. Immediately, the currency was transformed from a haven to a highly risky asset, sending the forex market into chaos. Some traders suffered from negative balances, and many brokers got forced to shut down.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black swan events like this have a steep cost for both traders and brokers since they directly affect financial markets. The worst part is that they are becoming more frequent. Within the past two decades alone, we've seen a global financial crisis, a rouble rout in Russia&rsquo;s economy, plunging oil prices, Brexit, and the persisting COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering that these events significantly affect the financial market, it's understandable that trading on financial markets might be considered too risky for some. But, what if you could trade without being affected by global events?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where synthetic indices trading comes in.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are synthetic indices?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/markets/synthetic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Synthetic indices</a> are unique indices that mimic real-world market movement but with a twist &mdash; they are not affected by real-world events. These indices are based on a cryptographically secure random number generator,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have constant volatility, and are free of market and liquidity risks.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why trade synthetic indices</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthetic indices offer tight spreads and leveraged trades. If you&rsquo;d like to give synthetic indices a try, you can trade them on Deriv. Depending on your risk appetite, you can try trading Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices using trade types such as <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a>, options, and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/deriv-multipliers-how-they-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">multipliers</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading synthetic indices give you additional advantages, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&rsquo;re aware of the potential risks right from the beginning; you won&rsquo;t be surprised by unexpected margin calls. </span>Margin calls occur when the balance on your account drops below your margin requirements, resulting in your positions become at risk of being closed automatically. You can fix the situation in two ways &mdash; deposit enough funds to increase your equity or close your positions.</li>\n<li>You don&rsquo;t need a lot of capital to start trading.</li>\n<li>You benefit from the fast order execution and deep liquidity at all times, which is attractive for all traders, whether small or large.</li>\n<li>You can trade these indices 24/7, including weekends and holidays.</li>\n<li>There are different levels of volatility &mdash; Volatility 10 Index, Volatility 25 Index, Volatility 50 Index, Volatility 75 Index, and Volatility 100 Index.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the Volatility 10 Index, the volatility is kept at 10%, which is an excellent choice for traders who prefer low price swings or fluctuations. With the Volatility 100 index, the volatility is maintained at 100%, meaning there are much stronger price swings and no significant price gaps. They are continuous indices with deep liquidity.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Platforms to trade synthetic indices on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the Deriv platforms where you can trade synthetic indices.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader</span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/169a8e74-d9a0-41c7-84a3-ade841052ae4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/169a8e74-d9a0-41c7-84a3-ade841052ae4\" alt=\"DTrader with an active trade\" width=\"2185\" height=\"1116\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> is Deriv&rsquo;s powerful, easy-to-use trading platform.

However, it did end 2021 with a gain of nearly 7% as the US investors are betting the Federal Reserve will raise rates sooner than most other major economies amid rising inflation brought about by Covid-19 stimulus initiatives.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Canadian dollar, which performed around flat against the dollar in 2021, was the best performer, helped by expectations that the Bank of Canada would begin tightening its monetary policy as soon as January. The worst performer against the majors was the Japanese yen, which is down around 10% this year.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite the euro reaching a seven-week high of around a $1.1365 level against the US dollar on the last day of 2021, the EUR/USD registered a dull start to 2022, falling approximately 0.20% intraday around $1.1340. While mixed concerns ruled the day, the market's consolidation at the year's first sluggish session led to a slight correction of the quote.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Above all, the Fed's monetary policy divergence from the ECB's will be key to watch in the year 2022 as the Fed is likely moving faster than the ECB towards a tighter monetary policy, which could weigh on EUR/USD prices.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, Wednesday&rsquo;s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting Minutes and Friday&rsquo;s US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) will be crucial for the pair traders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The pair is currently trading above its support at the 23.6% retracement level of $1.13142 and below its resistance at the 38.2% retracement level of $1.13850.</p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c8510f52-c6fe-4a2f-a991-1f4b7559297c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c8510f52-c6fe-4a2f-a991-1f4b7559297c\" alt=\"Commodities Chart Deriv Market Report 3 Jan 2022\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The year-end flows favoured gold against the US dollar (XAU/USD) for the week. This is due to the absence of major market moving news, negative reactions on the Wall Street indices, a pullback in the US dollar index, and the escalation of Omicron cases around the world. This new variant could trigger a continuous flight to safety in 2022, which will increase demand for risk-free government bonds and lower yields, alongside raising gold prices. Gold against the US dollar traded just under $1,830 and is trading close to the resistance level near $1,839 at 61.8% retracement level. The support level is around $1,765-$1,780 at 50% retracement level.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gold against euro (XAU/EUR) reached new highs for the first time since December 26, with bids hovering around &euro;1,608 in the early European morning on Friday. As a result, yellow metal prices in euro have risen for the second day in a row, continuing a significant increase seen on Thursday. In addition, the recent fall in EUR/USD amid Omicron concerns, the strength of US retail data, and the suspension of German 10-Year Treasury yields near the monthly highs could have contributed to the strength of the XAU/EUR. However, the record surge in daily French Covid infections and the 45% increase in monthly viral hospitalisations pose a challenge for XAU/EUR buyers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the energy markets, oil prices fell for the first time in eight days, with WTI crude falling $1.78 (2.3%) to $75.21 a barrel. Natural gas prices rose 46% in 2021, the highest year since 2016. OPEC + will hold a meeting on 4 January 2022, and will probably stick to their plan of adding 400,000 barrels per day of supply in February.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/843aa35a-872f-4253-95fc-5753c4958336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/843aa35a-872f-4253-95fc-5753c4958336\" alt=\"Crypto Chart Deriv Market Report 3 Jan 2022\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bitcoin traded close to the $47,000 mark during the year-end holidays on lower volumes than usual.

The year 2021 has proven to be one of Bitcoin&rsquo;s slowest with a yearly advance of 59%, the slowest since 2015 when it gained only 36%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ethereum in comparison gained around 380% in 2021, whilst Binance coin, the number three cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, soared over 1000% in value.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking into 2022, Arcane Research, a blockchain research firm made a number of predictions for the crypto market. Amongst them, Ethereum is expected to yet again outperform Bitcoin in 2022.

Retailers and other companies that depend on consumer spending accounted for a large share of these gains. Among them, Tesla (TSLA) rose over 16% after CEO Elon Musk announced he was \"almost done\" selling 10% of his stake.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq Composite followed the trend, recovering losses from earlier in the week to close up +0.55% and +0.85%, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthcare and technology stocks also helped lift the market, whilst traders notably bid up shares in hotel operators and other travel-related companies. In particular, the share price of American Airlines (AAL) went up by 10.5%, while Delta Airlines (DAL) closed 9.8% higher.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The markets also rallied after positive health data regarding Omicron and related hospitalisations emerged, shrugging off concerns that the variant would stunt economic recovery. This fact, coupled with upbeat consumer confidence levels and the release of upwardly revised domestic GDP levels, placed all three major averages in the green after a shaky opening.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another major boost for the markets came from the US Labor Department. The latest jobless claims report indicated 205,000 people filed for unemployment insurance last week, continuing its decline since the height of the pandemic. The department&rsquo;s latest figures reflect a strong labour market, fueled by a significant demand for workers in the coming year.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/842f543a-09e4-49e1-b8d7-99932d7cd761\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/842f543a-09e4-49e1-b8d7-99932d7cd761\" alt=\"Forex chart on Deriv\" width=\"3362\" height=\"1776\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCEs) Price Index data published earlier this week showed the largest annual growth since 1982 with 5.7% YoY in November. This result helped the US dollar hold firm against its rivals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD/JPY rates have been increasing in recent weeks, hitting a four-week high at the end of last week &ndash; the pair closed the week at $114.41. Given the upward trend, the 21-week Moving Average is around $112.00, and the 50-week Moving Average is roughly $110, determining the near support levels.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key factor driving the pair higher is the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s divergent monetary policy, which is likely to widen the spread between US government bond yields and Japanese government bond yields. Additionally, positive US economic data also supported the US dollar. With expectations of a tighter monetary policy by the Fed, the bullish momentum is expected to continue in the coming months, which will support the US dollar.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With trading action becoming subdued on Christmas Eve, EUR/USD appeared to have settled around mid-1.1300s on Friday, 24 December 2021. While the short-term bullish sentiment remains intact for the pair, thin trading conditions are likely to limit its movement for the remainder of the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD gained for the fourth consecutive day after pulling back from over a month's low. Recent reports suggested that the current vaccines were more effective than first thought against the Omicron strain, easing worries about the increase in COVID-19 cases in the UK. According to a UK study, fewer hospitalisations were attributed to Omicron infections, boosting the British pound.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, subdued demand for the US dollar gave the GBP/USD pair a modest lift. Next year's hawkish Fed policy, which implies at least 3 rate hikes, should limit USD downside and limit gains for the pair.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the lack of relevant economic data and thin liquidity conditions at year-end discouraged traders from making aggressive bets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e29994b2-33a6-4d45-b895-f310f94e1e4c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e29994b2-33a6-4d45-b895-f310f94e1e4c\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" width=\"3360\" height=\"1772\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result of the weakening US dollar, gold rose for the last 2 days, remaining above the $1,800 mark for the second week in a row. However, it was unable to cross its monthly high. From a technical point of view, gold closed at $1,808.81 and is trading below the 61.8% retracement level, near $1,830.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, traders exhibited a risk-on attitude by ignoring stronger US Treasury yields and drawing cues from favourable updates on the Omicron variant and the US stimulus. They are hoping that the latest COVID variant would not impede global development, giving Wall Street bulls the boost they need at this time of the year.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The price of oil climbed as well, with concerns about Omicron's impact on global economies easing and early data indicating that the virus caused milder disease.

Last week Bitcoin was up by an impressive 8% on the week, reaching an intra-week high of $51,65.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a market leader, Bitcoin influenced the performance of other cryptocurrencies with its upward momentum.

In late December 2020, Ethereum was trading around the low $700 mark. As the end of December 2021 approaches, Ethereum has seen an approximate rise of 450% (year-to-date), as compared to Bitcoin, which sits at a relatively low performance of 80% (year-to-date).</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Analysts attribute Ethereum's performance this year to its greater flexibility and integration potential with decentralised applications (dApp), decentralised finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFT).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X </strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading, and the Deriv X platform, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency trading is not available for clients residing within the United Kingdom.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>","published_date":"2021-12-27"},{"id":"622bf6cd-7c71-40cd-84d6-ea976dc4499d","main_image":{"id":"7e9e6112-75e8-4c60-b86a-67170a843f49","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/cac11/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.jpg","srcSet":"/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/89239/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.jpg 150w,\n/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/2c227/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.jpg 300w,\n/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/cac11/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.jpg 600w,\n/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/751a4/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/49f80/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.webp 150w,\n/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/de298/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.webp 300w,\n/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/52493/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.webp 600w,\n/static/145fe525105429d61ebf9d6a74e80b59/1eb60/Top%204%20trading%20styles%20%E2%80%94%20choose%20the%20one%20that%20suits%20you%20best.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"top-4-trading-styles-choose-the-one-that-suits-you-best","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"171","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"Top 4 trading styles — choose the one that suits you best","blog_description":"Quick trades or longer overnight positions? Explore the 4 most common trading styles and find out which one would work best for you!","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders generally prefer a particular trading style over another, and this is just one aspect beginners should be aware of as online trading requires a lot of knowledge and experience. If you are one, you need to select the right broker, understand the markets to trade, use the right platform, and identify the suitable trading style and strategy to use before you start trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we&rsquo;ll focus on the different types of online trading styles to help you determine which one may work best for you.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a trading style?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading styles are often confused with trading strategies. Although they are related, the two are actually different.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A trading style refers to a set of preferences that are unique to you, as they are based mostly on your trading plan, your personality, and availability to trade. This mainly includes factors such as the time you can devote to trade, your capital, and your risk appetite. By developing a trading style, you will be able to manage your trades better and be more disciplined, which in turn allows you to maximise your potential earnings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great thing about a trading style is that it isn&rsquo;t subject to any strict rules. To help you understand it better, here are the 4 types of trading styles that traders adopt.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day trading</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/93608e40-a1ca-4227-bc57-ebf65849e123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/93608e40-a1ca-4227-bc57-ebf65849e123\" alt=\"World stock exchange streaming trade screen.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Day trading is generally the most popular type of trading style. As its name implies, day trading involves buying and selling assets or opening and closing positions before the market closes within the same day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trading style is considered short-term, lasting for one day at most, with no positions held overnight. It allows traders to benefit from short-term market movements and avoid the risks and costs of keeping positions open overnight.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're someone who prefers to complete tasks by the end of the day, day trading may be ideal for you.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scalping</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d29e502e-41a8-414e-b4c5-82fe04fcb06b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d29e502e-41a8-414e-b4c5-82fe04fcb06b\" alt=\"Candle stick chart with numbers and BUY and SELL options.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scalping is frequently referred to as the quickest form of trading because scalpers (traders who adopt it) primarily hold positions for only a few seconds or a minute. Scalpers take advantage of an asset's bid-ask spread. This spread refers to the difference between the highest price a seller is willing to accept and the highest price a buyer is willing to pay. Basically, a scalper is buying or selling contracts at a bid-ask price, then closing their position at a higher or lower price for a profit shortly after.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus and attention are crucial in scalping, as you need to exit your trades immediately if the market starts moving against your predictions. If you like making instant decisions and acting on them without hesitating, this trading style could be for you.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Position trading</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5f358747-7867-464c-bf1d-2643a763a4a4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5f358747-7867-464c-bf1d-2643a763a4a4\" alt=\"A selector knob positioned on the word hold over a black background.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Position trading is a trading style that focuses more on large price movements and lasts for several weeks, months, or even longer. Traders use it as a long-term passive strategy to buy a contract and keep it for an extended period, whether it rises or falls in price.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Position traders collect data using long-term charts and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technical analysis</a> to forecast when trends will change. Such traders are looking for that one major market shift, which is why they open only a few high-value positions. This approach increases potential profits but also increases the risk exposure at the same time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may benefit from position trading if you're patient, stick to your trading plan firmly, and enjoy taking your time with your trades.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swing trading</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e4625d7-1f5c-4709-83a2-b3b0b5fd5f4e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e4625d7-1f5c-4709-83a2-b3b0b5fd5f4e\" alt=\"A selector knob positioned on the word hold over a black background.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swing trading is similar to position trading, but it only lasts a few days or weeks. This trading style exploits short to medium-term price fluctuations by capturing dips and peaks. A swing trader relies on technical analysis to determine these price points.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swing trading involves two types of market movements: swing highs and swing lows. Swing high refers to an asset's price moving upwards, while swing low refers to its price moving downwards.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swing traders prefer highly volatile markets in which swings occur more frequently. If you want to take on more volatility, this trading style may be the right choice for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not sure which style works better for you?

The Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite all rose sharply on Wednesday, 15 December 2021. Markets seemingly correlated a hawkish Fed stance with an optimistic, confident macroeconomic outlook &mdash; one that no longer needs the stabilizer wheels of low-interest rates to keep its economy from tipping.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, mid-week gains from Wednesday&rsquo;s rally were quickly wiped out during Thursday's session and again during Friday&rsquo;s close. The Dow Jones ended the week down by 1.65%, whilst the S&amp;P 500 dropped 89.66 basis points, ending the week 1.90% lower. The Nasdaq Composite drew up the heaviest hit, shedding 451.59 points to close the week trailing at -2.89%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an environment </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with increasing rates and reducing liquidity</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as the Federal Reserve accelerates its asset purchase taper, long-term growth and technology stocks are being pressured, as both are valued heavily on future earnings potential.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contrary to this, cyclical stocks across the financial and energy sectors outperformed the rest of the market on Friday, 17 December 2021, as rising interest rates boosted growth in these sectors.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0b1f7b29-138a-44e5-9bba-cb83094071ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0b1f7b29-138a-44e5-9bba-cb83094071ef\" alt=\"GBP/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"1677\" height=\"885\" /></a><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the US dollar gained as traders took flight from riskier currencies. Their decision was triggered by the central bankers' chatter of interest rate hikes and concerns about the rise in Omicron cases.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar index was up by around 0.6% during afternoon trading on Friday, 17 December 2021.

In response to a surprise interest rate hike from the Bank of England (BoE), the GBP/USD pair reached a mid-week high of $1.337 for the first time since late November. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the BoE is the first central bank to raise interest rates.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As crude oil prices dropped by 2% on fears that Omicron will reduce global demand, commodity-linked currencies, including the Australian and Canadian dollar, fell against the US dollar.

It is possible that OPEC+ could meet before their scheduled meeting on&nbsp; 4 January 2022 if changes in the demand outlook warrant a review of their plans to add 400,000 barrels per day of supply in January.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerns over the Omicron surge and rising inflation drove traders to safe-haven assets on Friday, 17 December 2021, causing gold to climb above $1,800 for the first time in 5 weeks. The Federal Reserve&rsquo;s forecast of up to 3 rate hikes next year would typically weigh on gold as higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion. However, gold gained despite inflows into the US dollar, which is also considered a store of value during uncertain times.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">XAU/USD closed at $1,798 on Friday, 17 December 2021. The pair is currently trading right under its resistance at the 61.8% retracement level, near $1,801.

Fears related to the Omicron variant seemed to be abated with initial studies by BioNTech and Pfizer showing a booster shot would be effective against the virus. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite recorded their best weekly gain since February, whilst the Dow Jones recorded its best weekly gains since March. The US Large Cap growth stocks outperformed the value stocks, mainly driven by Information Technology stocks such as Apple (AAPL) and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main highlights of last week included:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\" aria-level=\"1\">The CPI report released on Friday, 10 Dec 2021 showed the inflation rate came in at 6.80%, the highest level since 1982. However, excluding the categories of food and energies, the inflation rate was at 4.90% &mdash; in line with expectations.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\" aria-level=\"1\">The labour market has also shown signs of improvement, with the rate of unemployment below 4.20%. Prior to the release of the CPI report, the yield on the 10-year note was high but then flattened.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\" aria-level=\"1\">The 10-year Treasury Yield was at 1.49%, up 1.34% from last Friday, 10 Dec 2021. However, it is far below the recent high of 1.68%. This data may reflect the fact that higher inflation could lead to a faster tightening of the monetary policy by the Fed.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week, the focus is on the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, 15 Dec 2021, as this is the last one for the year and based on comments from the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, the Central Bank may speed up the taper of its $120 billion monthly bond purchases to tackle the surge in inflation. The Fed is expected to provide economic projections on growth, inflation and unemployment levels.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/253ed920-34ab-42d7-8daf-bddf40bad67b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/253ed920-34ab-42d7-8daf-bddf40bad67b\" alt=\"Gbp chart on Deriv \" width=\"2792\" height=\"1546\" /></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors bet that even if inflation rose higher than expected, the interest rate hike pace would remain the same in the wake of Friday's CPI report. The dollar lost ground after consumer prices rose approximately in line with expectations in November.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the UK tightens its coronavirus restrictions once more, the pound is headed for its first yearly loss since 2018. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is encouraging people to work from home to prevent the spread of Omicron. This measure has stoked fears about the country's sputtering economy and forced traders to pare back their bets on an interest rate hike, which just weeks ago looked like a done deal.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A shift in sentiment has seen the pound retreat to the $1.33 level against the dollar. The GBP/USD is trading close to its support level near $1.31 at 61.8% retracement level, followed by the next support level near $1.28 at 50% retracement level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is, however, the Bank of England&rsquo;s monetary policy decision that will get the most attention this week. Final policy decisions of the year are also to be made by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank this week. While parts of Europe experience far stricter lockdowns, there is little doubt the European Central Bank will remain dovish.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/edf01026-2504-41a4-9d22-fe0d536bd7f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/edf01026-2504-41a4-9d22-fe0d536bd7f5\" alt=\"Gold Chart on Deriv \" width=\"2800\" height=\"1548\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />Oil markets let out a sigh</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of relief </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upon hearing that the Omicron strain may not hinder global demand as potently as originally feared. With recent demand remaining stagnant and global crude inventories well below their 5-year average, oil markets appear to be at a temporary sweet spot, with Brent Crude and WTI trading around the $75.00 per barrel and $72.00 per barrel mark, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Brent and WTI Crude benchmarks broadcast gains of around 8% last week, their largest weekly gains since late August. This occurred whilst several downside risks are still weighing on the horizon. Weak international air traffic and rising covid cases across Europe may still be looming in the eyes of investors, but soaring US inflation figures are adding to oil&rsquo;s bullish sentiment, largely counteracting the above-mentioned risks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investors will keep an eye on whether WTI crude can break through its first major resistance level around $74.00 at the 78.6% retracement level. Looking downwards, its first major support level lies around the $65.00 level at 61% retracement, followed by its second support of approximately $59.00 per barrel at the 50% retracement level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the metal markets, gold prices gained momentum on Friday, 10 Dec 2021 although not enough to stop its fourth straight weekly fall. Investors kept to the sidelines ahead of November&rsquo;s 40-year high Inflation figures that could influence the Fed&rsquo;s next changes to monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gold gained 0.1% to hit $1,776.23 per ounce, whilst bullion prices dropped 0.4% as rising inflation and a strengthening labour market left investors inclined towards caution. Should the Federal Reserve decide to further accelerate the pace of its asset purchases in line with the interest rate hikes, it could impact the future price of gold.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f3e4b235-521a-4bd9-b828-62a8ba2012f6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f3e4b235-521a-4bd9-b828-62a8ba2012f6\" alt=\"Btc Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2792\" height=\"1548\" /></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crypto market continued to slump after last week&rsquo;s minor crash, as investor </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sentiment</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hit its lowest levels since July 2021. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana, (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB) and Cardano (ADA) were all down between 1-5% on Friday, 10 Nov 2021 from the previous 24 hours.

All you need to do is intuitively identify a shape or pattern in your price chart and outline it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to studies, our eyes tend to look for patterns everywhere, so finding one in a price chart is quite easy. But it is important to understand the concept of support and resistance trend lines first, as they define almost all the chart patterns.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are trend lines?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A trend line in a price chart is a line that connects a few price points of your selection, e.g. the opening prices within the past week or month. Whenever the price crosses this line, it&rsquo;s called a breakout, and that&rsquo;s when a new trend is usually formed. The breakout serves as a signal to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d22729fd-ad29-4866-99d5-6c4130cc7dae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d22729fd-ad29-4866-99d5-6c4130cc7dae\" alt=\"Price Breakout in A Candlestick Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support and resistance are arguably the most widely used trend lines in trading.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are support and resistance trend lines?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support and resistance trend lines represent levels that act as barriers where the price tends to stop moving forward. Support is the bottom price level where the downtrend meets support and stops falling. And resistance is the top level where the uptrend meets resistance and stops rising.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/34f6de2a-7e68-43e9-8197-cd474e4a8453\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/34f6de2a-7e68-43e9-8197-cd474e4a8453\" alt=\"Support and Resistance Trend Lines on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like almost everything else in trading, support and resistance are influenced by supply and demand. Here is how it works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s say the price of gold has been gradually decreasing over the past few days. As you probably know, the price goes down when traders sell an asset in large quantities, and supply starts exceeding demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is a group of people who want to buy gold when it&rsquo;s as cheap as 50 USD per gram, for example. Once they start buying it at 50 USD, the demand will increase, exceeding supply, and the price will start going up again.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the price dropped to 50 USD, bounced off, and started going up again. The 50 USD price level is the support in this case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resistance is essentially the same process but reversed. Let&rsquo;s say some people missed the opportunity to buy gold at 50 USD, and they are willing to pay more, but only as much as 100 USD. As soon as the price reaches 100 USD, they will stop buying it, the demand drops, and the price stops increasing. The100 USD price level will act as resistance in this case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, the price quite often forms a trend, bouncing between the same support and resistance price levels. But eventually, after reaching one of these levels, the price doesn&rsquo;t bounce back and keeps moving in the same direction (falling below 50 USD or rising above 100 USD in our example), that&rsquo;s when a breakout occurs. That&rsquo;s exactly why you need trend lines and chart patterns &ndash; to catch the moment it happens.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are drawing tools?&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you visualise and define trend lines in your price chart, trading platforms are usually equipped with drawing tools. For example, here are the drawing tools on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/62870d56-c422-40b6-9f91-cd02da032e03\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/62870d56-c422-40b6-9f91-cd02da032e03\" alt=\"Drawing Tools in Deriv&rsquo;s D Trader Trading Platform\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use any of them to draw right over your price chart and delete the drawings whenever you want. If you're a beginner, the 'Line' tool is the easiest to use, since it's the most straightforward way to draw trend lines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, here are the support and resistance trend lines made with the help of &lsquo;Line&rsquo; drawing tool.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/14b4466b-c703-42b2-83c3-f9db7276c3de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/14b4466b-c703-42b2-83c3-f9db7276c3de\" alt=\"Support and Resistance Trend Lines in Deriv&rsquo;s D Trader Price Chart\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading on support and resistance trend lines can be a strategy on its own.

Considered as safe-haven currencies, both the Swiss Franc and the Yen appreciated against global currencies and bond yields due to concerns about the spread of the Omicron variant which has led to restrictions around the world.

Australia's economy finds itself at the front-end of the global supply chain, making the following developments around Omicron significant. Since the last RBA meeting, the AUD/USD has fallen from 0.7532 to 0.7000. The RBA will meet this week to discuss monetary policy. Given the significant movements in AUD/USD since the last RBA meeting, it is important to watch the RBA's interest rate decision on Tuesday, 7 Dec 2021, and commentary about the economic conditions driving their decision. AUD/USD broke its support at the 61.8% retracement level of $0.70500, making it the new resistance level &mdash; the new support level at 50% retracement is near $0.67500. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the release of a weaker-than-expected US jobs report, the dollar reversed gains to trade flat on the day. The report still contained positive revisions for previous months and solid details about the labour market. Despite the Omicron threat, markets quickly bounced back from disappointing jobs data after the Fed announced committing to its current level of tapering and asset purchases. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the UK front, doubts have grown over the forecasted December interest rate set by the Bank of England after the rate setter noted that more information about Omicron might be beneficial before changing policy settings.

The sell-off also occurred amidst an unsettling sentiment around the chatter of impending crypto regulations from international governments.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now trailing towards recovery, Bitcoin is settling slightly below its first major resistance levels near $54,400 at 50% retracement. In the event of additional market turmoil, Bitcoin should receive support at around $50,900 at 38.2% retracement. A breach of this key level would see Bitcoin's next major support at the $46,600 mark at the 23.6% retracement level.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade US indices, forex, and commodities with options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and with CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial and Financial STP accounts.

Find out what it is, and how it works.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The key factor that determines a trader's success is their ability to predict the price movement of an asset correctly. However, it's not about guessing &ndash; you can analyse the market and make informed decisions in trading, which ultimately increases your chances of potential profit.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 2 types of market analysis that you can apply to any financial market: technical and fundamental. Experienced traders usually combine both types of analysis and use a combination of various instruments to increase their chances of a correct prediction. In this blog post, we'll focus on technical analysis, and in the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamental analysis for beginners</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog, we'll cover how fundamental analysis works.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is technical analysis?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technical analysis is purely based on analysing the past price movements. It is not affected by political and economic events in any way. Its ultimate goal is to identify patterns, predict future market behaviour, and determine the right time to buy (or sell) an asset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technical analysis can be performed in 2 ways: by identifying chart patterns or using technical indicators, both of which we'll go through in this blog post.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both cases, you'd need to understand how to read a price chart, so let's go through that first.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the price charts in technical analysis?&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A price chart is a graphical representation of a price movement of an asset over a selected period of time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every chart has a horizontal axis that represents time and a vertical one that represents the price. This screenshot, for example, shows the price fluctuations of the Volatility 10 index from August to November 2021.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/400350c0-b30a-447d-a385-c01da9176d85\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/400350c0-b30a-447d-a385-c01da9176d85\" alt=\"Price Fluctuations of Volatility 10 Index from August to November2021.\" width=\"1473\" height=\"884\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The price chart is essentially price movements in little units of time intervals. The time intervals can be set individually and typically depend on personal preference. Some traders prefer more detailed charts and set 1-tick or 5-minute intervals, while others prefer having a bigger picture and use hourly, daily or even weekly charts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A tick chart, where 1 tick reflects 1 unit of price change, provides traders with the most detailed data, as it displays the price change every 1-2 seconds. This type of chart is mostly used in options trading and is available on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dbot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DBot</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chart types&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 3 most commonly used chart types are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candlestick chart</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bar chart</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line chart</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Candlestick chart</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most popular charts among traders is a candlestick chart. Below is a screenshot showing how it looks.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/04d88eb0-0352-43d1-884b-cefcfbf2d286\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/04d88eb0-0352-43d1-884b-cefcfbf2d286\" alt=\"Candlestick Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each candlestick consists of a body and a wick that display the opening and closing prices of your selected time interval, as well as the highest and lowest prices reached within that time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d6041ac7-3fa2-4653-881d-ca9fb7b4841d\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d6041ac7-3fa2-4653-881d-ca9fb7b4841d\" alt=\"Anatomy of Candlestick on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The body of the candlestick (the main square part) shows the opening and closing prices. If the body is red (black on some other platforms), it means that the closing price is lower than the opening price, with the opening price at the top of it. And if the body is green, the closing price is higher than the opening, with the opening price at the bottom.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The candlestick's wick (the lines at the top and/or bottom of the body) reflects the highest trading price reached within the set time interval at the top and the lowest at the bottom.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let's say you choose to view your chart with 1-minute candlesticks. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each candlestick will reflect the asset's opening and closing prices (the body) of each minute, with the highest and lowest prices reached within the minute (the wick).</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bar chart</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bar chart, also referred to as OHLC chart, follows the same logic as a candlestick chart, but using bars instead of candlesticks. OHLC stands for the opening, the highest, the lowest, and the closing prices. Similar to candlesticks, the bars can be coloured (e.g. on DTrader) or just black (e.g. on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv MT5</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/eb55f741-2936-4d63-8a5b-63d70773d074\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/eb55f741-2936-4d63-8a5b-63d70773d074\" alt=\"Bar Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3aa88b66-0ee2-4304-8444-99036196a7b4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/3aa88b66-0ee2-4304-8444-99036196a7b4\" alt=\"Anatomy of Bar Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Line chart</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A line chart displays only the closing price of an asset. While it provides less information, it also reduces the noise on the screen &ndash; which is great if you prefer your charts to look uncluttered. The line of the chart connects the closing prices of your selected time intervals (e.g. of every minute) which helps you clearly see movement trends. This type of chart is available on Deriv MT5.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A line chart can also be displayed as an area chart. In this case, the space between the horizontal axis and the line is filled with colour. This type of chart is available on DTrader.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a346f7d5-9f94-4584-ad0d-de9d6794a519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/a346f7d5-9f94-4584-ad0d-de9d6794a519\" alt=\"Line Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some time intervals, like ticks, are too short to provide enough data to form a candle or a bar; hence, they can only be displayed with the line chart.</span></p>\n<h2>Chart patterns and technical indicators<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chart patterns and technical indicators are the 2 different ways of evaluating the price charts and market behaviour.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A chart pattern is a shape (e.g. a triangle) that you can draw over your price chart with the help of various drawing tools, just like you would draw a line, connecting the dots on a piece of paper. Identifying these shapes in a chart helps to suggest where the price is going to move next.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A technical indicator is a tool that helps suggest future price movements with the help of complex mathematical calculations. These indicators are also placed over your charts, and they calculate the potential price movements automatically, using historical data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When doing technical analysis, you don&rsquo;t have to choose one way over the other. In fact, you can use both chart patterns and technical indicators simultaneously to have more data to analyse.

All 3 major indices dropped sharply in the half-day session as a new Covid variant, recently named Omicron, was discovered in South Africa triggered a global shift away from risk assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World Health Organisation officials announced that further investigations of the new strain are needed. But fears of it showing resistance to current vaccines sent shock waves through the financial markets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concurrent market highs at the start of November seem far-off following Friday's market shift. Bond prices lifted as yields tumbled amidst a flight to safety. The benchmark U.S. Treasury note lost 15 basis points to close at 1.48%. This marked a sharp reversal from the 1.68% level that was hit earlier in the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Travel stocks were hit the hardest. Delta Air lines and American Airlines were down 7.08% and 7.12%, respectively, and Boeing Co took a nose-dive to end the week 11.45% lower. Bank shares also pulled back, along with industrials linked to the global economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week's winners were those whom investors huddled into during the sell-off, namely vaccine makers. Pfizer was up 4.29%, whilst Moderna shares skyrocketed above 20%. Corporations that support stay-at-home workers also benefited, with Zoom and Netflix each gaining more than 5%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on the new vaccine developments. Investors are banking on a quick containment of the new strain for global markets to calm. Jerome Powell, newly re-elected Chair of the Federal Reserve, is also expected to make a statement on future monetary policies this week. As inflationary pressures remain a threat, market watchers will be watching for any reactive changes in monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade US indices options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.798%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.9863%;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9c6ecc39-71ff-41a4-b692-d8e626e474f6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/9c6ecc39-71ff-41a4-b692-d8e626e474f6\" alt=\"Eur Usd Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2800\" height=\"1556\" /></a></td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.9863%;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/34ea31a4-6f4a-45ee-9106-e20910b6da2b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/34ea31a4-6f4a-45ee-9106-e20910b6da2b\" alt=\"Gbp Usd Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2802\" height=\"1542\" /></a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data for EUR/USD has been relatively mixed. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) in the EU for November was better than expected, signalling an increase in inflation during the month. In the US, the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Price Index was also better than expected on a yearly basis.

EUR/USD ended at the $1.13 mark, and its next support level at the 38.2% retracement level is near $1.123. The resistance for EUR/USD at the 50% retracement level is near $1.14.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD stayed on the lower end last week despite better than forecasted Purchasing Managers Index readings.

This week will feature the Purchasing Managers Index readings for the GBP, ADP Non-Farm Employment Change and Non-Farm Payroll for the USD. The pair ended at $1.33, and its next support level is the 61.8% retracement level near $1.31, followed by a 50% retracement level near $1.28.

The reason behind the downfall was mainly due to the surge in the Treasury yields. The renomination of Jerome Powell as the Fed chair was also a factor, strengthening the view that the interest rates are going to hike up by June 2022.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recently detected COVID variant led global equities to suffer heavy losses, and the 10-year Treasury yield to fall below 1.50% at the end of the week leading to XAU/USD finishing near $1,788.85. The support level at the 23.6% retracement level is near $1,772.55.

China, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the U.S. are agreeing to release barrels of crude oil to help cool down the price. OPEC is set to meet this week, and these demand concerns could cause them to delay or halt their planned increase in the supply of oil. Oil is currently trading at the $68 mark, just above its support level at the 78.6% retracement level near $66.

It has been recognised for centuries as a store of value, meaning it can hold its worth over a long period of time and doesn&rsquo;t depreciate. It&rsquo;s one of the reasons why many regard it as a sign of wealth as well.</p>\n<p>This metal is highly malleable and doesn&rsquo;t degrade, which is exactly why it&rsquo;s considered precious, making it one of the most widely traded raw materials across the globe today. Due to its popularity and high value, its price fluctuates more than other commodities. Many online traders see these price movements as great trading opportunities to acquire more potential gains.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we&rsquo;ll go over what gold trading is, what influences its price, and how to trade it online alongside other assets.</p>\n<h2>What is gold trading?</h2>\n<p>Gold trading refers to speculating on gold&rsquo;s price to make a profit, and there&rsquo;s a number of ways you can do this online. On Deriv, you can trade gold with <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/trade-types/cfds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/trade-types/options/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CFDs and options allow you to predict gold&rsquo;s price movements without having to own or buy it. These trade types give you more flexibility since you don't have to adhere to the typical buy low-sell high approach, letting you potentially profit from both rising and falling markets. Regardless of the position you take, your goal is to correctly predict the future direction of the market.</p>\n<p>With CFDs, you can go long or go short and keep your trade open as long as you want if you have sufficient capital to maintain it. The more the market moves in your favour throughout the period of your trade, the greater your potential gains. However, the more it moves against you, the more losses you'll incur.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whereas with options, you predict price movements within a set timeframe. Plus, you know beforehand how much your potential payout is and your loss is limited to your stake.</p>\n<p>Read our &ldquo;<a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What is CFD trading?</a>&rdquo; blog to find out how CFD trading works. If you prefer options trading, check out our &ldquo;What is options trading&rdquo; blog.</p>\n<h2>Factors affecting gold prices</h2>\n<p>As with any other asset, gold's price is influenced by both supply and demand. Gold prices fall if the market becomes saturated with supply and the demand for it isn't sufficient enough to match. However, if the demand is strong and the supply is low, gold prices rise.</p>\n<p>A number of factors influence gold's supply and demand, resulting in significant price fluctuations. Here are 3 of them.</p>\n<h3>Value of the US dollar</h3>\n<p>Gold is a dollar-denominated metal, meaning its price is pegged to the value of the US dollar. This influence greatly impacts gold's price. Whenever the value of the dollar drops, people turn to other investments to reserve their wealth, and gold is seen as the best option due to its intrinsic value. Additionally, a declining dollar increases the purchasing power of other currencies, potentially boosting demand for gold, causing its price to rise.</p>\n<h3>Rising inflation</h3>\n<p>Inflation occurs when a particular currency's purchasing power weakens. As a result, people seek safe haven assets. A safe haven is an investment that is expected to retain or increase in value during times of market volatility.</p>\n<p>Gold is generally considered a safe haven asset. Although it's more volatile than other assets in the commodity market, its volatility is still very low compared to other markets. That&rsquo;s why, many use it as a hedge against inflation to reduce their exposure to losses.</p>\n<h3>Scarcity in production</h3>\n<p>Mining and recycling are the two major sources of gold production. However, due to the finite nature of gold and the fact that most of the world's gold reserves have already been mined, it&rsquo;s expected to deplete over time.</p>\n<p>To meet the demand, what's currently on the market is being recycled and more companies are exploring advanced mining technologies to locate gold deposits. However, any new discovery will spike gold's price in the short-term since everyone wants to get their hands on it. And, following the law of supply and demand, if the supply cannot keep up with the demand, it&rsquo;s price is expected to continue rising.</p>\n<h2>Platforms to trade gold on Deriv</h2>\n<p>Trading gold is available on a number of platforms on Deriv.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can trade gold with CFDs on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv X</a>.

During the week, the S&amp;P posted a gain of 0.32%, while the Dow took a dive, translating to a 1.35% drop. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq posted some impressive gains, rising 2.37% for the week &mdash; a historic close for the Index. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq-100 surged higher as tech stocks appeared to be the popular choice amongst investors.

In a downtrend, EUR/USD is currently just below the 38.2% retracement level at $1.127, followed by the 23.6% retracement level at $1.10. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GBP/USD gained a bit of momentum this week as CPI (YoY) data came in at 4.2% vs 3.9% expected. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retail Sales for the month were up 0.8% vs 0.5% forecast, whereas, for the US dollar, Retail Sales were up 1.7% vs 1.0% forecast. The GBP/USD pair ended the week near $1.34, and its next support level is the 61.8% retracement level near $1.31, followed by a 50% retracement level near $1.28.

Retail sales were higher than predicted, fueling strong inflation. However, gold managed to go up briefly on Wednesday, 17 Nov 2021, by 0.86% amidst a 4 basis point drop in the 10-year US Treasury Yield. Gold then slipped due to the market rallying on Thursday, 18 Nov 2021, with Large Cap Tech outperforming. XAU/USD finished the week near $1,845.00, and its next support level is the 38.2% retracement level near $1,830.00, followed by a 23.6% retracement level near $1,770.00. On the upside, resistance for XAU/USD is near $1,875.00 at 50% retracement levels, followed by $1,920.00 at 61.8% retracement levels. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 19 Nov 2021, gold against euro closed at &euro;1,634.91, maintaining its upward trend from the previous 4 weeks. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This movement was primarily due to the ECB keeping interest rates below zero and pushing back the possibility of a rate hike in the near term. If the ECU decides to hike rates, the situation could potentially weaken gold's value with inflationary pressures rising across Europe. The technical analysis indicates that XAU/EUR is facing resistance near the 78.6% retracement level of around &euro;1,670.00. On the downside, the pair faces resistance at its 61.8% retracement level around &euro;1,605.00, and &euro;1,560.00 at its 50% retracement level. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil ended at $76.10 and has been declining for the past 4 weeks. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This decline can mainly be attributed to the increasing Covid-19 cases in the Eurozone and the possibility of the US and China releasing crude oil reserves to lower the price. As per the chart, it is currently above the 78.6% retracement level, near $66.00. On the upside, if things change, at the 127.2% retracement level, it may climb up to $105.00.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade commodities options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/259b47c5-3e8a-40cc-bbfc-341bbf2af7ec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/259b47c5-3e8a-40cc-bbfc-341bbf2af7ec\" alt=\"BTC/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"2804\" height=\"1550\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">China&rsquo;s renewed pressure on crypto, the new U.S. tax-reporting provisions, and India&rsquo;s idea of possibly allowing trading only on pre-approved virtual currencies contributed to Bitcoin falling below the $56,000 mark on Friday, 19 Nov 2021. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, since then, the global cryptocurrency capitalization surged marginally by 0.55% to $2.63 trillion.

This blog will explain what it is, how it works, and which markets to trade it with.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage is one of the many terms you&rsquo;ll hear floating around in the online trading world. However, not everyone understands what it means. So in this blog, we'll talk about what leverage is, how it works, and what markets you can trade with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is leverage</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leverage is a crucial aspect of <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFD trading</a>. It refers to using borrowed funds to increase your trading position beyond what your cash balance allows.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many traders take advantage of leverage to improve their strategies and maximise their potential gains. But, there's a catch to leverage: it can also result in larger losses than expected if it's not used strategically. That's why before applying it to your trades, make sure you've carefully analysed the markets and are sufficiently confident it will benefit you.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How it works</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, leverage lets you open larger positions for a fraction of the trade&rsquo;s value. For example, if you want to open a CFD of asset X that costs 1,000 USD, even if you only have 10 USD, you can do so with leverage of 1:100.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The higher the leverage, the lower the capital you need to open a trade. This in turn boosts the purchasing power of your capital allowing you to take advantage of small price changes and to expand your market exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Margin refers to the deposit required to open a leveraged position, taking into account spreads, leveraging, and currency conversions. You use a <a href=\"https://deriv.com/trader-tools/margin-calculator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">margin calculator</a> t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o determine how much margin you need to increase the market value of your position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if asset X has a price of 100 USD and the leverage is 1:100, then the required margin to open 1 CFD of X will only be 1 USD.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;d like to open a position of 100 CFDs (or 100 lots) of X with a buy order (you expect that the prices of asset X will increase), here are the possible outcomes of the trade opened with leverage:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the price of X increases to 105 USD, you make a profit of 5 USD per CFD.<br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you bought 100 CFDs, this gives you a total profit of 500 USD </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(100 CFDs ✕ 5 USD = 500 USD).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the price of X decreases to 95 USD, your total loss is 500 USD.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on these outcomes, leverage can increase profits, but it can also increase losses.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to manage risk in leveraged trading</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraged trading involves high risks, so it&rsquo;s smart to use standard risk management features on trading platforms such as stop loss and take profit. Stop loss and take profit orders will help limit the potential loss you may incur or secure the profit you make.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you place a stop loss order, you specify the exact price at which your position will automatically close at a loss. It lets you specify how much you want to risk, allowing you to limit your losses before they grow larger than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas when you place a take profit order, you specify the exact price at which your position will automatically close. This allows you to secure your target profit before the market moves against your favour.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Markets to trade with leverage on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The markets you can trade with leverage on Deriv are forex, stocks and stock indices, cryptocurrency, commodities, and synthetic indices. Each of these markets operates differently so it&rsquo;s important to be careful when trading them with leverage.

Maybe not in the exact same way when it first began, but the concept of exchanging goods remains. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Defining commodities</h2>\n<p>Commodities are divided into two broad categories &mdash; hard commodities, which are made up of natural resources that are extracted or mined; and soft commodities which are generally agricultural products that are grown.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These two categories are further divided into four groups &mdash; metals and energy within hard commodities; agricultural, livestock and meat within soft commodities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.7585%; height: auto; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;\">\n<th style=\"width: 46.6026%; height: 25px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>Hard commodities</strong></th>\n<th style=\"width: 46.6026%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>Soft commodities</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 25px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><strong>Metals</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><strong>Energy</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><strong>Agricultural</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\"><strong>Livestock and meat</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 25px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gold</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Crude oil</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Soy beans</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Live cattle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 25px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Silver</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Natural gas</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Coffee</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Lean hogs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 25px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Copper</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Gasoline</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Grains</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Milk</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height: 18px;\">\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 25px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Platinum</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; border: 1px solid #000000; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;\">Cotton</td>\n<td style=\"width: 23.3013%; height: 18px; text-align: center; border: 1px solid #000000;\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><sub>* The list above shows only a few examples. In reality, each group is made up of many more individual products.</sub></em></p>\n<p>The value of each commodity depends on several factors, including supply and demand. But because commodities are raw materials, natural events like floods or pandemics can also have a significant impact on the value of a commodity. For example, a flood can affect the production of crops leading to less supply, or a worldwide pandemic affecting the demand for oil as travel becomes restricted. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Popular commodities&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2b4c5769-fe2a-4ce7-a822-d1a515eddfd8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2b4c5769-fe2a-4ce7-a822-d1a515eddfd8\" alt=\"Oil barrels on gold bars showing what are commodities\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the most popular commodities to trade is oil. As an essential source of energy, there&rsquo;s a high global demand for this natural resource resulting in a highly liquid market for crude oil, making it a favourite among traders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Deriv offers the two most traded types of oil in the market &mdash; West Texas International (WTI) which is extracted from the oil fields in the US, and Brent oil which is mined from the North Sea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another popular commodity is gold. Gold has been traded throughout history &mdash; it&rsquo;s a popular commodity to invest in and has long been considered a store of value. A store of value is an asset that usually retains its value over time, without being significantly affected by economic or natural disasters. This means that even if the value of other assets fall, traders who have invested in gold don&rsquo;t need to be too worried.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, investing in and owning gold isn&rsquo;t the only way you can take advantage of this precious metal. You can start trading gold by speculating on its price movements &mdash; the value of this liquid asset is strongly affected by supply and demand. For example, a worsening economy will often see gold rising in value as demand will rise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With Deriv, you can trade the price of gold in three ways &mdash; against the US dollar (USD), against a basket of five currencies (via the Smart Gold index), and against Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What is commodities trading</h2>\n<p>Commodities trading today involves the buying and selling of goods, just as it did in its early days. This usually takes place in exchanges, and investors typically trade on commodities through futures contracts, where the buyer and seller agree upon a price for future delivery of the physical asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Traders can also trade commodities with <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs (contracts for difference)</a> and digital options, both of which Deriv offers. These two trade types give you the opportunity to participate in the commodities market without needing to take ownership of the actual physical asset.</p>\n<p>With CFDs and digital options, you speculate on the price movements of an asset without needing to buy it. Simply put, you predict whether the price of an asset will rise or fall. If the market moves according to your prediction, you gain a profit. This means that you can possibly gain a profit whether the value of an asset rises or falls.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On Deriv, you can trade commodities on a variety of trading platforms, each with its own unique advantages &mdash; <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv X</a> for CFDs, and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a>, <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dbot/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DBot</a>, and <a href=\"https://smarttrader.deriv.com/en/trading.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmartTrader</a> for digital options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sign up for a <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free demo account</a> to start exploring the commodities market.

Try weekend trading on Deriv and take advantage of the markets that never sleep.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There&rsquo;s a common misconception that you cannot trade over the weekend because most financial markets are closed. The truth is, there are still markets that you can trade on Saturdays and Sundays.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the interest in trading growing exponentially by the minute due to easier access to financial markets, more traders are looking for ways to continue trading every day, even on weekends. To meet this demand, more brokers now offer weekend trading.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why trade on the weekend</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For seasoned traders, trading on the weekend provides more time to refine their trading strategies, allowing them to take advantage of more market movements. If you&rsquo;re a beginner and want to find out if it&rsquo;s right for you, here are the 3 reasons to consider.</span></p>\n<h3>1. More time to trade</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Weekends give you more trading time and more opportunities to take advantage of price movements. In contrast to weekdays, you have fewer distractions, allowing you to think through your trades and limit the risk of making hasty decisions just because you want to seize trading opportunities.</span></p>\n<h3>2. More flexibility to trade at your convenience</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For some, trading on weekdays is nearly impossible. With busy schedules and commitments throughout the week, the weekend is the best option as it offers flexibility &mdash; you enjoy the freedom to choose the hours that best fit your schedule.</span></p>\n<h3>3. Keep your trades open</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trades you make during the week will still be able to run through the weekend even if the market is closed. Your trading conditions, such as stop loss and take profit, will remain in place but will not be triggered for the markets that are closed. If you need to close a trade manually, you can do so whenever you want. But, if you&rsquo;re confident about your trades, maintaining your position over the weekend can provide you with additional potential gains.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How the weekend can help you improve your trading</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weekends offer the perfect time to go over how your trades performed. You have the leeway to review your trading journal, evaluate market conditions with more focus, and examine the changes you need to implement in your strategies if they are not working in your favour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial markets behave differently throughout the week, so if you'd like to perform an in-depth technical or fundamental analysis for your trades, the weekend provides you the leniency to do so.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's also a good time to evaluate whether you've let your emotions influence your trading decisions. Have you held on to your trades too long? Did you overestimate your trading ability? If so, the weekends give you the chance to contemplate how you've been trading and make necessary adjustments.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Markets to trade during the weekend</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two markets that never sleep which you can trade on Deriv &mdash; synthetic indices and cryptocurrencies.</span></p>\n<h3>Synthetic indices</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/markets/synthetic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Synthetic indices</a> are unique indices that mimic real-world markets but are not affected by global events or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">market and liquidity risks.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They are backed by a cryptographically secure random number generator and offer different levels of volatility depending on the trading conditions you prefer. You can choose from Volatility indices, Crash/Boom, Jump indices, Step indices, to Range break indices.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can trade synthetic indices on </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deriv MT5 and Deriv X (with CFDs), DTrader (with options and multipliers for as low as 0.35 USD), DBot (with options) and Deriv GO (with multipliers).</span></p>\n<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cryptocurrencies</a> are digital currencies that are decentralised, meaning they are neither issued nor backed by an authority such as a central bank or government. Due to the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets, they are favoured by traders who like more risk in their trades.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade the world's most popular cryptocurrencies, with over 17 crypto pairs available. You can trade them on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X (with CFDs), Deriv GO (with multipliers), and DTrader (with multipliers).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are not familiar with these markets, you can practice your trading skills first. Start with a free <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">demo account</a>, which comes pre-loaded with 10,000 USD of virtual money that you can use and top up when it runs out.

Although yields continued to fall for the next two days, the yield curve started to flatten, with the 2-year yield rising above 0.52%, strengthening the US dollar and limiting the upside potential for gold.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to this, on Thursday, 28 October 2021, the GDP was announced by the BEA and was not up to par with the forecast (2.0% vs 2.7%), leading to a fall in the US dollar. However, this was not for long as the economic data on initial jobless claims was favourable (281K vs 290K), retreating gold at around $1,800.17 high.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On 29 October 2021, gold slipped by around -$18.70 at $1,783.02 due to the rise in the US yields.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s next?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ISM manufacturing PMI is scheduled for next week, followed by the FOMC meeting later in the week. If the policymakers adopt a hawkish approach, the US dollar will outperform, and gold could turn bearish in the near term. On the other hand, if the policymakers adopt a dovish approach, downplaying the inflation concerns and focusing on the fall in GDP (Q3) would create selling pressure on the dollar and allow gold to go up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initial jobless claims and Non-farm Payrolls are also scheduled for the week wherein a strong figure could support the US dollar and vice versa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trade Gold options on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and CFDs on</span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong> </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2><strong>EUR/USD</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/747f9b4f-80a7-43d6-bafe-47e05ecdf29b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/747f9b4f-80a7-43d6-bafe-47e05ecdf29b\" alt=\"EUR/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"2818\" height=\"1556\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><br /></strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happened last week?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, the European Central Bank (ECB) kept its monetary policy unchanged. Despite inflationary concerns, the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, insisted that inflation is transitory and shall decrease next year. The GDP announcement (2.0% actual vs 2.7% forecast) cooled down the expectations for aggressive tapering in the US. The reason for the downfall was mainly attributed to slow consumer spending and supply chain concerns.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What&rsquo;s next?</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US will be publishing the ISM manufacturing PMI on Monday, 1 November, 2021, with the forecast at 60.4 (the previous at 61.1).

However, which cryptocurrency should you choose? There are thousands of digital coins on the market, and each one has its own features.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Deriv, we've narrowed down the list of cryptocurrencies available to fund your cryptocurrency account to five major and popular cryptocurrencies. Let's take a closer look at their unique characteristics.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Bitcoin (BTC)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is the most well-known and accepted cryptocurrency in the world. The unique features of this digital coin have turned it from being just another coin to exchange into a store of value with high purchasing power &mdash; an equivalent of gold in the crypto world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like the famous precious metal, Bitcoin has a limited supply (21 million coins only), and it is also decentralised. The limited supply provides protection from inflation, while the decentralisation protects from the control and influence of governments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BTC transaction specifications are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: approximately 30 minutes&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 3 (3x10 minutes each = about 30 minutes)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: high</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Ethereum (ETH)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum was created as an open-source blockchain platform to create, release, and monetise apps, where Ether token served as a payment method. Due to its popularity, it eventually became accepted as a payment currency by merchants and service providers outside the platform.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. However, experts believe that the value of this digital coin is still underestimated and should be much higher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifications for Ethereum transactions are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: from 1 to 15 minutes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 6 (6x10 seconds = 1 minute)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high, depending on network congestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Litecoin (LTC)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Litecoin is widely considered to be the silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold. It was indeed created to complement Bitcoin as a more accessible and more affordable cryptocurrency. As a result, Litecoin has quickly become a new medium of exchange &mdash; used for payments, while Bitcoin transformed into a store of value &mdash; an asset that will have purchasing power in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Litecoin has a much larger but still limited supply of 84 million coins and significantly lower transaction fees, which made it the most inexpensive option for cryptocurrency transfers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifications of LTC transactions are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: approximately 30 minutes&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 12 (12x2.5 min each = about 30 minutes)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: very low</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stablecoins: USDT (OMNI &amp; ERC-20) and USDC</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is tied to an asset like USD or gold to stabilise its price. Generally speaking, stablecoin is a digital representation of fiat money.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Tether (USDT) OMNI&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tether is by far the largest stablecoin by market cap. Each unit of Tether is backed by the USD with a 1:1 equivalent. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies, Tether is issued and regulated by Tether Limited, which makes it a fully centralised cryptocurrency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The &lsquo;omni&rsquo; part of this digital coin means that Deriv accepts USDT transactions that are proceeded via omnilayer &ndash; a software built on top of Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &lsquo;erc-20&rsquo; part means that the USDT transactions are also processed via the new transport layer based on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It gives Tether the security of Bitcoin or Ethereum while letting it operate as an independent cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USDT OMNI transaction specifications are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: from 1 to 15 minutes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 6 (6x10 seconds = 1 minute)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high (depending on network congestion)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifications for ERC-20 (eUSDT) transactions are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: from 1 to 15 minutes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 6 (6x10 seconds = 1 minute)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high, depending on network congestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. USD Coin (USDC)&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD Coin is the second-largest stablecoin that is also tied to the USD with a 1:1 ratio but powered by Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain. This coin is also centralised and held by a group of three companies that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency. USDC is currently the most transparent stablecoin in the crypto world, and it is accepted by hundreds of companies worldwide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USDC transaction specifications are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: approximately 30 minutes&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 3 (3x10 min each = about 30 minutes)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high, depending on network congestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know the main differences between these cryptocurrencies, all you have to do is choose your preferred one to fund your Deriv crypto account.

Last week, gold hit the $1,800 mark and dropped back to $1,764. In the absence of major fundamental data, gold prices might be confined to the same range. It might also focus on the development of the US treasury yield and the US dollar index. The first resistance levels appear to be $1,780 - $1,786 followed by 50% retracement levels near $1,800, while $1,750 &ndash; the previous week's low &ndash; might provide some support, followed by the major downside channel support near $1,720.</p>\n<p>Trade Gold options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Financial account.</p>\n<h2 id=\"eurusd\">EUR/USD</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/7d811632-17ba-4396-9222-6ea96aead59a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/7d811632-17ba-4396-9222-6ea96aead59a\" alt=\"EUR/USD chart on Deriv\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1222\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The EUR/USD pair has been moving sideways, too, for the past week.

It&rsquo;s no wonder that more traders choose to trade with crypto &mdash; because it can potentially generate more crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many people are still hesitant to get started with it. For those who lack the </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">basic knowledge of crypto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, joining the crypto world may seem expensive or complicated. We&rsquo;re here to clear up that myth and other common myths about cryptocurrency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3>Myth #1: Crypto is expensive</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not really. The price can be quite high if you decide to buy the entire Bitcoin at once. But you can also buy and own tiny fractions of it, otherwise known as satoshis. For example, if you place a trade on Deriv, the minimum trade amount required for Bitcoin is 0.0001 BTC, which currently costs less than 5 USD!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3>Myth #2: You&rsquo;ll need to learn a whole new market&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you decide to trade </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cryptocurrency, yes, you'll probably need to know a thing or two about the market. But you don't need to learn about an entirely new market if you're trading </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crypto. It's just like using USD, EUR or any other fiat currency, where all you have to do is select your favourite market to trade. Then place your trade with the cryptocurrency of your choice. If you don&rsquo;t want to trade the crypto market, trade with it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3>Myth #3: The only way to have more crypto is to buy it&nbsp;</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade with cryptocurrency on markets like forex or synthetics and earn a payout, you're adding to your crypto wallet. Yes, you do need to buy cryptocurrency to start using it, but after your initial purchase, you can potentially earn more through your trades. Just like gaining profit in fiat currency, you're gaining profit in cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can you start trading with crypto?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are already familiar with trading, it&rsquo;s not that different. Let&rsquo;s go through the steps in detail.</span></p>\n<h3>1. Open a crypto account</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people use so-called wallets to keep their crypto safe. The wallet can be in the form of an app or a device but, on Deriv, it&rsquo;s easier. You don&rsquo;t need to download another app or buy another device. You can just keep your cryptocurrency in your Deriv account and place trades directly from there. All you need to do is:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Click on the triangle next to your account balance, click on Real, then click on Add or manage account.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/7499d68b-7061-4e93-a5fc-80aedb46ea2d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/7499d68b-7061-4e93-a5fc-80aedb46ea2d\" alt=\"How to Open A Crypto Account on Deriv \" width=\"786\" height=\"491\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select the cryptocurrency account you would like to add and click Add account.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/30c28c66-191b-4198-8426-9d9f39d555ed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/30c28c66-191b-4198-8426-9d9f39d555ed\" alt=\"How to Open A Crypto Account on Deriv 2 \" width=\"800\" height=\"488\" /></a></p>\n<h3>2. Buy crypto using one of our fiat to crypto exchanges</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat to crypto exchange, also called fiat onramp, is a cashier service that allows you to convert your fiat currency into cryptocurrency. In other words, you buy crypto with regular money.

If you are ready to proceed, here is what you need to do:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select your new cryptocurrency account, go to the cashier page and select fiat onramp.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fa19f826-b829-4423-894b-602848a47e2c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/fa19f826-b829-4423-894b-602848a47e2c\" alt=\"How to Select Fiat to Crypto Exchange on Deriv\" width=\"800\" height=\"394\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select your preferred fiat to crypto exchange option.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/da5cbfff-6122-4736-9d1f-1b4edccfef5d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/da5cbfff-6122-4736-9d1f-1b4edccfef5d\" alt=\"Fiat to crypto exchange on Deriv\" width=\"433\" height=\"444\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete the required steps to prove your identity and proceed with the transaction.</span></p>\n<h3>3. Place your trade</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Congratulations!

There is a possibility of gold prices bouncing back for a short period due to the lack of an established trend. If it crosses next to the watch, it will be around $1,798 as it has a resistance zone at $1,764-1,770. On the downside, the next major support level is near the 38.2% retracement level of around $1,689. The US employment data scheduled to release on Friday, 08 October 2021, may shed some light on how gold prices will trend in the future.</p>\n<p>Trade Gold options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\">&nbsp;<strong>DTrader</strong></a>&nbsp;and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\">&nbsp;<strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a> Financial account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>Options trading on commodities and forex on DTrader are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</em><br /><br /></p>","published_date":"2021-10-04"},{"id":"1878bc89-5963-4f8a-b929-c90271f3d765","main_image":{"id":"bb77b3fd-fd68-4805-87d1-eb5ac69864cb","description":"Market report on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/cac11/market%20report%20image%201.jpg","srcSet":"/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/89239/market%20report%20image%201.jpg 150w,\n/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/2c227/market%20report%20image%201.jpg 300w,\n/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/cac11/market%20report%20image%201.jpg 600w,\n/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/751a4/market%20report%20image%201.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/49f80/market%20report%20image%201.webp 150w,\n/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/de298/market%20report%20image%201.webp 300w,\n/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/52493/market%20report%20image%201.webp 600w,\n/static/faad32fc2e4ebdab000c1867580d5a39/1eb60/market%20report%20image%201.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-27-09-2021-03-10-2021","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"107","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 27 Sep 2021","blog_description":"Forex and gold were bearish last week.

Weak German PMI data and hawkish Fed comments have put pressure on euro prices. On top of that, the market also reacted to the news of a Chinese property developer's potential downfall, which could disrupt the global market. EUR/USD is trading just near its yearly low of 1.1663. Based on this week's RSI, the index is trading at 42, indicating an upward trend, while the momentum indicator is trading below 0, indicating oversold conditions. For the coming week, Germany's election results may influence the market, and technically, EUR/USD may find support near 1.1590 if it breaks the yearly low of 1.1663.

In fact, it was the lowest weekly close in the last six months. During the week, it went further down, and closed below its major support of 50% retracement levels of $1,755. RSI is making a lower low on a weekly basis, suggesting a short-term bearish outlook for gold. In addition to the trend reversal level previously, gold has major support near the 61.8% retracement level near $1,680. On the upside, it might try to recover up to the $1,780-$1,790 zone. Fundamentally, the market will wait for Fed chairman Powell&rsquo;s speech on Wednesday, followed by major US manufacturing PMI data on Friday.</p>\n<p>Trade Gold options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">&nbsp;<strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Financial account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>Options trading on commodities and forex on DTrader are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom.</em></p>","published_date":"2021-09-27"},{"id":"e406e9ac-607c-462f-afa2-84efc7becfb3","main_image":{"id":"8d6a968e-f765-476f-acfb-79743426fab3","description":"Market report on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/cac11/market%20report%20image%203.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/89239/market%20report%20image%203.jpg 150w,\n/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/2c227/market%20report%20image%203.jpg 300w,\n/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/cac11/market%20report%20image%203.jpg 600w,\n/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/751a4/market%20report%20image%203.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/49f80/market%20report%20image%203.webp 150w,\n/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/de298/market%20report%20image%203.webp 300w,\n/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/52493/market%20report%20image%203.webp 600w,\n/static/a86d6db0a0233572f44e15f680ddbe48/1eb60/market%20report%20image%203.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-20-09-2021-26-09-2021","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"109","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 20 Sep 2021","blog_description":"Is the upcoming FOMC policy going to affect the gold, forex, and Nasdaq markets?

While on the higher side, $15,500 will act as the first resistance level followed by a trend reversal level of $15,712.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trade US Tech Index options on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <strong>DTrader</strong></a><strong> </strong>and CFDs on<a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> <strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a> Financial accounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>Options trading on stock indices, commodities, and forex on DTrader, are not available for clients residing within the European Union or the United Kingdom. </em></p>\n<p><em>CFD trading on cryptocurrencies on the Deriv MT5 platform and multipliers trading on cryptocurrencies on the DTrader platform are not available for clients residing within the UK.</em></p>\n</div>","published_date":"2021-09-20"},{"id":"e7aee366-c2c2-4204-987f-b72604f3f6e6","main_image":{"id":"7362df6c-9afa-482f-a672-f72a0a3cea93","description":"Multipliers potentially amplifying profit similar to leveraged trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/cac11/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/89239/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.jpg 150w,\n/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/2c227/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.jpg 300w,\n/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/cac11/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.jpg 600w,\n/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/751a4/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/49f80/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.webp 150w,\n/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/de298/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.webp 300w,\n/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/52493/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.webp 600w,\n/static/b8015c36d56b01f339c54ba493bf36e9/1eb60/Deriv%20multipliers%20%E2%80%93%20how%20they%20work.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"deriv-multipliers-how-they-work","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"63","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Multipliers"}}],"blog_title":"Deriv multipliers: How they work","blog_description":"Find out what multipliers are, how you can amplify potential profits, and how trading with Deriv multipliers is different from leveraged trading.","blog_post":"<p>Trading with leverage allows you to take a larger position in the market with a small amount of capital. However, leveraged trading also comes with the possibility of large losses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Not on Deriv multipliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multipliers allow you to amplify your potential profits in a similar way as leveraged trading. You simply apply a multiplier to your trades to potentially multiply your profit. But unlike leveraged trading, you won&rsquo;t be increasing your potential losses at the same time.</p>\n<h2>How multipliers work</h2>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s an example. Let&rsquo;s say you trade with a stake of 100 USD and predict the market will go up. The market then goes up by 2%.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.7709%;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 48.3604%; height: 150px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><strong>Without a multiplier</strong>, your profit is:</p>\n<p>2% x 100 USD = <strong>2 USD</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 48.3604%; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><strong>With a x500 multiplier</strong>*, your profit is:</p>\n<p>2% x 100 USD x 500 = <strong>1,000 USD</strong></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>On the other hand, your losses are limited to your stake when trading multipliers on Deriv. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 99.7691%; border-style: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<td style=\"width: 300px; height: 150px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p>On <strong>leveraged trading with 1:500* leverage</strong>, your loss is:</p>\n<p>2% x (100 USD x 500) = <strong>1,000 USD</strong></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"width: 300px; height: 150px; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">Regardless of the multiplier you choose, the stop out feature will limit your loss to your stake of <strong>100 USD.</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>*multiplier values and leverage differ per country you&rsquo;re trading in</p>\n<h2>Benefits of trading with multipliers</h2>\n<h3>Ramp up your trades</h3>\n<p>Add a multiplier to your trades &mdash; the higher the multiplier, the higher your potential profits. (If you reside in the EU or UK, your multiplier values are pre-determined based on the asset you&rsquo;re trading.)</p>\n<h3>Limit your risk</h3>\n<p>Risk losing no more than your initial stake with the automatic stop out function &mdash; on every single trade.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Manage the possibilities</h3>\n<p>Secure your profit automatically, protect your stake, and feel free to change your mind with <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">risk-management features</a> like take profit, stop loss, and deal cancellation.</p>\n<h3>Trade anytime, anywhere</h3>\n<p>Trade multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-forex-live-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forex</a>, <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/cryptocurrency-trading-for-beginners-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptocurrencies</a>, and Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/an-introduction-to-synthetic-indices-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">synthetic indices</a> on both desktop and on Deriv&rsquo;s mobile app, Deriv GO.

It also made a fresh five-month high last Friday. It moved a massive 9% from the recent flash low it made in the month of August at the $1680 level. On a daily basis, the 100 SMA has crossed the 200 SMA, indicating a Golden crossover for the short to medium term. However, it is important for the prices to cross the $1830-40 zone, which it has failed to cross for the last four months. On the daily and weekly time frames, the RSI is trading at 53 and 61 respectively, which suggests further upside is likely. Technically, once it manages to cross its immediate resistance zone, the next level to watch out for will be the $1849 and $1877 levels.

In addition to major political shifts, the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic affected everything from our day-to-day lives to the performance of the economy and major financial markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it was not all bad. The Brazilian stock market performance changed completely during the pandemic, and experienced a major boost. To illustrate this point, we take a look at the two most striking pieces of data collected by the S&atilde;o Paulo Stock Exchange Index (IBOVESPA) this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On February 25, there was a variation of -2.86.</li>\n<li>On May 7, there was a variation of 1.77.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What happened?</h2>\n<p>In an interview with InfoMoney, XP Investments chief strategist Fernando Ferreira explained the reasons behind this growth. Based on Ferreira's analysis, this spike was the result of a supercycle in commodities as well as Brazil being the country with the largest number of products in the category.</p>\n<h2>Who grew?</h2>\n<p>The result of this change quickly reached the big brands. Vale, for example, benefited from the appreciation of iron ore, its flagship export product, which grew by more than 30% in 2021. On May 7, this material reached 200 USD a ton, a number reached for the first time in history.</p>\n<p>In more direct numbers, this change promoted gains of 42.33% for Vale in 2021, with 4.59% in May alone. The company's shares now account for 12.3% of the composition of the theoretical portfolio of IBOVESPA.</p>\n<p>In addition to iron ore, gains were also recorded through oil. During the first five months of 2021, Brent barrels rose 34.43% and reached $69.42. However, this increase may deceive investors who do not take their eyes off Petrobras.</p>\n<p>Despite its shares advancing 11.47% in this period, the company continues operating in the red. Much of this is due to the country's political instability, which promotes interventions that frighten specialists in this area.</p>\n<h2>Overcoming the pandemic</h2>\n<p>In the same InfoMoney article, BNP Paribas equity fund manager, Marcos Kawakami, explained the stock market growth in relation to overcoming the crisis caused by Covid-19.</p>\n<p>According to Kawakami, the gradual attempts to return to normality, combined with fiscal stimulus for infrastructure development, is one of the main reasons for this growth. This can be explained by the increase in the use of raw materials, acquired in large volumes in situations of this kind.</p>\n<p>\"We also do not see a large increase in the supply of commodities in the short term, so this trend of appreciation should continue.\" added Kawakami.</p>\n<h2>US instability reflected in the world</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5fa39eeb-0648-4429-920f-d89142220f93\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5fa39eeb-0648-4429-920f-d89142220f93\" alt=\"Man at A Laptop Trading on The Brazil Stock Market \" width=\"2999\" height=\"1999\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ferreira also pointed out a possible global concern with the continued increase of US inflation. Seeking a way to protect themselves from this phenomenon, many investors look to Brazil as an alternative, since materials are directly related to the values of basic products.</p>\n<p>Levante Capital's analysis team commented to InfoMoney, saying: \"(...) despite some scares regarding inflation, the central banks of the United States and Europe must maintain the 'stimulating' monetary conditions. And in times of abundant money and zero or negative interest, one of the alternatives for investors around the world is to buy commodities to defend against the currency's loss of value.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In addition to troubled political relations, macroeconomic risks are connected to the potential growth of the country's debt over GDP. Therefore, the team recommended an attentive view at this moment.</p>\n<p>They said: \"We were so cheap and so far behind that we ended up experiencing a confluence of benign factors: we are now in the best possible place to take advantage of a market that seeks to protect itself from inflation.\"</p>\n<h2>Between banks</h2>\n<p>Kawakami also referred to the constant growth of banking institutions as one of the main factors that contributed to the boost in the stock exchange. Among the brands that have strengthened the most are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Banco do Brasil, up 8.3%</li>\n<li>Ita&uacute; Unibanco, up 5.2%</li>\n<li>Bradesco, up 5.4%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This can be explained by the increased dependence of companies on the big names, at least that is according to the banking sector analyst at XP Investments, Marcel Campos. Campos elaborated that this increase occurred despite the fall in the return on equity (ROE) of these groups, as a result of the Central Bank's actions to encourage the growth of fintechs.</p>\n<p>One fintech that has been gaining ground in the Brazilian market is <a href=\"https://www.paylivre.com/en/homepage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Paylivre</a>, a digital portfolio that facilitates electronic payments, deposits, and withdrawals on trading sites, binary options, forex and diversified investments in several countries. For example, many Brazilian users are able to access Deriv, through Paylivre, which has generated a revolution in the domestic market, bringing new possibilities and new markets to its audience.</p>\n<h2>Looking to the future</h2>\n<p>Brazil&rsquo;s economy has been recovering gradually. &nbsp;And although it is neither an easy nor a quick process, each step is an important step forward. The year 2021, despite being difficult, still has the potential to be a productive year for the Brazilian economy.</p>\n<p>Studies carried out by XP Investments led to the company revising its annual projection for the IBOVESPA for the end of 2021, increasing its forecast of 135 thousand points to 145 thousand. Bradesco BBI's analysis team also followed the same path, pointing to an increase of 130 thousand points to 135 thousand.</p>\n<p>The main factors that could explain these changes are the discreet accommodations in the country's long-term interest rates and the increase in profit expectations of companies involved.</p>\n<p>For XP Investments, this could mean a 199% increase in sales per share compared to 2020. If compared to 2019, this growth should still be 125%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, 2022 still appears to be a very cloudy landscape for some areas. Although projected earnings for this period are stable due to the normalisation of commodity prices and the weakening of the dollar, some companies are not willing to take any chances.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bradesco BBI, in turn, still estimates an increase of 140 thousand points to 150 thousand for 2022, based on a supposed improvement in the economic scenario, a view shared by BNP Paribas.</p>\n<p>However, Marcos Kawakami of BNP Paribas warns of a probable differentiation between companies, as had occurred between 2010 and 2016, a period in which the two extremes reigned in this environment.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>References:</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2SH9JR0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brazilian stock market is among the best in the world in May thanks to the commodities super-cycle: will the rise continue?&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2R91Bbv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IBOVESPA (IBOV) &nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3c4G1Mq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IBOVESPA closes practically stable and has the 4th session in a row without falls; dollar drops to BRL 5.25.</a></p>","published_date":"2021-09-02"},{"id":"863301dc-f57c-436e-8585-9c8b8ae58b21","main_image":{"id":"903fff73-19b0-43d3-b917-9999c1a7fb34","description":"Market report on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/cac11/market%20report%20image%204.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/89239/market%20report%20image%204.jpg 150w,\n/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/2c227/market%20report%20image%204.jpg 300w,\n/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/cac11/market%20report%20image%204.jpg 600w,\n/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/751a4/market%20report%20image%204.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/49f80/market%20report%20image%204.webp 150w,\n/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/de298/market%20report%20image%204.webp 300w,\n/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/52493/market%20report%20image%204.webp 600w,\n/static/3809ac4e67e629bc059031580bbbc93e/1eb60/market%20report%20image%204.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-08-2021-05-09-2021","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"112","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report – 30 Aug 2021","blog_description":"Gold prices held their three-week positive trend.

If you've already heard about </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CFD trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but are still unsure about whether to start, let's talk about its major benefits and the easiest strategy for beginners to start their CFD trading journey.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Wide selection of markets and assets</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main advantages of CFD trading is access to all the largest financial markets at once &ndash; forex, commodities, stocks &amp; indices, and cryptocurrencies. You can have a wide selection of assets in every market, which gives you the opportunity to diversify your portfolio. This is considered a good risk management strategy to prevent big losses.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Deriv, you have an additional option to trade synthetic indices, a market that is available round the clock, much like the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, all the markets and assets can be accessed within the same platform &ndash; Deriv MT5.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Opportunity to profit from both falling and rising markets</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In CFD trading, you predict the price movement of an underlying asset without buying it. Remember, you&rsquo;re trading on a contract for difference, not the actual asset. So it doesn't matter if the price rises or falls; as long as it moves according to your prediction, you may earn a profit. Unlike other trade types, a CFD trade can be opened not only with a buy order (going long) but a sell order (going short) as well, even if you don&rsquo;t have anything to sell.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s say you believe the price of an asset will go down because the company failed to reach its targets for the quarter, which usually leads to a sell-off &ndash; a large number of its shares being sold at a low price. If you place a sell order on its stock CFD, and your prediction is correct, you earn a profit. To execute this kind of trades successfully, it&rsquo;s important to understand the general logic behind </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">going long and going short</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in CFD trading.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Cost-effective capital utilisation</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As CFDs are typically traded on margin, you can use it as an opportunity to build a cost-effective trading strategy. Since you only need to pay a small percentage of the trade value, your budget can be allocated into several trades at once. There is also a stop loss feature to protect you from losing too much of your capital if the trade goes against your prediction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, you don&rsquo;t have to pay an additional tax on asset ownership since you don't own the underlying asset when trading CFDs, which can be a big advantage. Most brokers also don't charge a commission for CFD trading, making it even more cost-effective.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can beginners benefit from the advantages of CFD trading?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional traders have quite a few CFD trading strategies. Some of them are very complex and require technical knowledge. But, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that beginners can&rsquo;t benefit from the advantages of this form of trading. Here is a relatively easy way to start: news trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most financial markets are affected by economic and political events in one way or another. As a result, big announcements are usually followed by big price fluctuations of the related assets. For example, the UK pound has experienced a big drop right after Brexit. And Bitcoin&rsquo;s price went skyrocketing when Tesla bought over a billion USD worth of it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping an eye on the big headlines and learning how they affect the prices would be a good beginning of the CFD trading journey. Once you know how to connect the dots, you can start predicting the price movements and benefit from them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're not confident with news trading, you can opt for trading synthetic market. With Deriv&rsquo;s synthetics trading, you trade CFDs on indices that simulate real-world market movements but are not affected by world events. On this market, the price movements are randomly generated by a cryptographically secure algorithm and are regularly audited by a third party for fairness.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever market you choose to start, you can do so by creating a demo account to get your practice in before investing any money.

On Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms, you can also avoid increased losses when the market moves against you. In this blog post, we explain how the risk-management features on Deriv&rsquo;s platforms make them excellent choices for trading multipliers.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4 ways Deriv gives you more control over your multipliers trade&nbsp;</h2>\n<h3>Automatic stop out&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>When you trade with multipliers on Deriv, you can never lose more than your stake. With an automatic stop out feature, your positions are automatically closed as soon as your losses are equal to your stake amount.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Take profit</h3>\n<p>Usually, you will need to close your position manually to secure your profit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The take profit feature allows you to automate this process. All you have to do is set a level of profit you&rsquo;d be satisfied with. If your profit reaches or exceeds this amount, your position will be closed and your profit will be added to your account balance.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Stop loss</h3>\n<p>Stop loss lets you set exactly how much you are willing to risk. You can cut your losses before you lose your entire stake.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whenever your loss equals or exceeds your stop loss amount, your trade will be closed automatically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, you open a trade with a 10 USD stake. The automatic stop out will close your trade when your losses reach 10 USD. However, if you want to minimise losses even further, you can set a stop loss level of 5 USD. When your loss reaches this amount, your trade will automatically close.</p>\n<h3>Deal cancellation</h3>\n<p>Opened a trade, but having second thoughts? With deal cancellation, you have the option to cancel a trade within a selected time period (depending on the market and asset you&rsquo;re trading) after opening it and reclaim your stake. Please note that Deriv charges a small fee for this service.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>With these 4 risk-management features, trading multipliers on Deriv can help you avoid missing out on opportunities and prevent you from losing more than you're willing to lose. <a href=\"https://oauth.deriv.com/oauth2/authorize?app_id=16929&amp;l=en&amp;brand=deriv&amp;date_first_contact=2021-06-07&amp;signup_device=desktop&amp;utm_source=deriv_direct\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Log in</a> or <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sign up for a free demo account</a> to give Deriv multipliers a try.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>\n<p><em>The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for users residing within the EU.</em></p>","published_date":"2021-08-25"},{"id":"71eb0c26-c21b-45b3-9a95-40c9b3408ce3","main_image":{"id":"fd9ee8a0-0eec-49cc-be9a-1eca308741e7","description":"Tips and tricks of the online trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/cac11/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/89239/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 150w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/2c227/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 300w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/cac11/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 600w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/751a4/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.jpg 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/49f80/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 150w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/de298/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 300w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/52493/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 600w,\n/static/1659780a4a77d9e20721f6331c652a07/1eb60/Useful%20tips%20on%20how%20to%20trade%20online.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":600,"height":330}}}},"slug":"useful-tips-on-how-to-trade-online","featured":false,"visibility":"visible_to_all","tags":[{"id":"174","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"Useful tips on how to trade online","blog_description":"We outline useful tips on how to trade online by looking at how experienced traders trade. Based on the ebook ‘7 traits of successful financial traders’.","blog_post":"<p>Every trader goes through their own trading journey, some admittedly more successful than others. Based on the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>' by veteran trader and self-made millionaire Vince Stanzione, we go through how successful traders plan their trading strategy and what you can learn from their examples.</p>\n<h2>They cut their losses and let winning trades run</h2>\n<p>Trading comes down to psychology &mdash; everyone wants to win; no one wants to lose.</p>\n<p>When faced with an unprofitable trade, experienced traders don&rsquo;t let it run and hope things will get better. They know it&rsquo;s a bad idea to keep an unprofitable trade open and let it accumulate losses, which will also make it harder to gain any profit. They know when to cut their losses.</p>\n<p>The following table explains why cutting your losses is crucial. It shows the returns needed to break even for unprofitable trades. For example, if your trade has already lost 5%, you&rsquo;ll need the position to move in your favour by 5.3% to break even.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/58222a1a-6e6b-4c9f-8c1a-6f7e16973262\" alt=\"Returns Needed to Break Even\" width=\"438\" height=\"331\" /></a><br /><br /></strong></p>\n<h2>They plan their exit strategy</h2>\n<p>Inexperienced traders tend to focus on when to open a trade, but pay little attention to closing it. According to Vince Stanzione, deciding when to exit a trade is even more critical than deciding when to enter it.</p>\n<p>Your exit rule to take a profit or loss should be determined before you start trading, and you should stick to it. It shouldn&rsquo;t be some afterthought that you consider while your trade is running. Once you open a trade, your psychological responses can change, and your emotions can influence your decisions. So, it&rsquo;s important to have an exit strategy and follow it.</p>\n<h2>They diversify</h2>\n<p>It may seem like a common trading tip you often hear &mdash; diversify your portfolio. While you should diversify by trading on a variety of markets and assets, you can also add diversity to your strategy by trading on the different directions of price movements to lessen your risk.</p>\n<p>With the availability of digital options and contracts for difference (CFDs), you can trade on markets that go up, down, and even sideways. You don&rsquo;t need to only trade on markets or assets that are only moving in one direction.</p>\n<h2>They let trends be their friends</h2>\n<p>Experienced traders follow trends and profit from them. Trends can be up or down, but overall traders gain more from an uptrend because a market can go up by an unlimited amount, whereas the most a market can go down is 100%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In his ebook, Vince Stanzione says that successful traders trade according to what they see, not what they think is going to happen. They depend on the numbers to tell them what is happening &mdash; if the price of an asset rises from 60 to 65 to 70, it is going up &mdash; &nbsp;and they trade accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They are masters of their emotions</h2>\n<p>After facing a few losses, new traders may doubt their trading strategy and start thinking about changing their approach. But if you keep changing your strategy, how will you know if it works?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Markets don&rsquo;t usually perform as we would like them to. Plus, many external factors can affect your emotions and trading judgment. This is why you need to learn to recognise when you are getting emotional about your trades &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s feeling unsure about your strategy or an attachment to your positions. Remember to follow your trading strategy, and don&rsquo;t trade emotionally.</p>\n<h2>They keep it simple</h2>\n<p>Many new traders think they need lots of fancy software, multiple trading screens, and a super-fast internet connection to trade successfully. But the truth is, while they may be helpful, these tools won&rsquo;t help you financially succeed as a trader.</p>\n<p>Keep things simple. Deriv gives traders access to a variety of trading platforms and various financial markets. Sure, you can check out extra trading plugins or systems for some extra help if you&rsquo;re a new trader, but you don&rsquo;t need to spend thousands of dollars on fancy software to become a successful trader.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>They know what they can control</h2>\n<p>However smart we think we are when it comes to trading, we are dealing with unpredictable elements when we trade. What we know and what we can control should help us decide how much we can risk. Determining these is what you should be spending time on.</p>\n<p>For example, how much risk you can allow yourself to have per trade. This is something you can control even though market prices fluctuate or an asset doesn&rsquo;t perform as you had predicted. Build a plan to manage your trade finances, and follow through with it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Download the full version of the ebook '<a href=\"http://deriv.link/blog-ebook-7traits-05042021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 traits of successful financial traders</a>', by Vince Stanzione, veteran trader and self-made millionaire.
