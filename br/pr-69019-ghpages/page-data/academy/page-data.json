This fall was a result of financial markets being gripped by panic as recession fears persisted and inflationary pressures rose, further intensified by Russia's energy crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second consecutive week, the British pound declined against the US dollar, bringing prices to their lowest since March 2020. Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend. The chart above shows that the pair was priced just above the 5 and 10 SMA's, ending its week at around $1.2035.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the USD/JPY pair continued to rise, it did not break through its 24-year high of &yen;137.00. The US June payrolls eased recession fears, causing the USD/JPY to rise. Furthermore, the inaction of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) towards its ultra-loose monetary policy and Shinzo Abe's assassination have hindered the yen's value and weakened the Japanese economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will be important for currencies since the US and the UK will release June inflation figures and UK GDP data.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment. However, it was down by 3.53% for the week. The chart shows the drastic drop and highlights that gold ended the week between a thin resistance and support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 2% on Friday, 8 July 2022, as the market remained concerned about whether the jobs sector is strong and the possibility of the Fed raising rates aggressively. However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general. Furthermore, worries over a potential recession pulled prices down for the week and led to oil prices touching their 12-week low mid-week.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, the price went above the $22,000 mark on Friday, 8 July 2022 and maintained its upward momentum since the start of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, also increased by around 9% in the last 7 days.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022.

As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week.

The pair ended the week at the $1.0519 level, which lies slightly under the SMA 10 at $1.0527 and coincides with the SMA 5 at $1.0519.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD pair declined for 4 consecutive days and closed the week at the $1.2316 level, which lies marginally above its SMA 5 at $1.2122. The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK. Furthermore, the receding resistance line has countered any upside movements by the cable pair since mid-April. The pair now awaits the Fed and Bank of England (BoE)&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions coming later this week for the next directional bias.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair has almost reached the &yen;135 level, hitting over two-decade highs. This price movement can be attributed to relentless dollar demand in the US due to inflation and stronger yields. As a result, the pair came under selling pressure, which caused a drop from the long-term highs.<br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The yellow metal's price went up significantly after a higher-than-expected inflation result. As seen within the chart, gold dipped below the $1,835 mark post the CPI data's release but bounced back to post a 1.64% change for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bond yields and gold are in an inverse relationship once again. With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs. This scenario resulted from US consumer prices growing faster than expected.

Altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) fell by around 6-10% for the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market leader Bitcoin fared better than other coins, falling by only 3% in the past 7 days.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation fell by around 11% last week and was trading below $1,500.

This fall was a result of financial markets being gripped by panic as recession fears persisted and inflationary pressures rose, further intensified by Russia's energy crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second consecutive week, the British pound declined against the US dollar, bringing prices to their lowest since March 2020. Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend. The chart above shows that the pair was priced just above the 5 and 10 SMA's, ending its week at around $1.2035.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the USD/JPY pair continued to rise, it did not break through its 24-year high of &yen;137.00.

Furthermore, the inaction of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) towards its ultra-loose monetary policy and Shinzo Abe's assassination have hindered the yen's value and weakened the Japanese economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will be important for currencies since the US and the UK will release June inflation figures and UK GDP data.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment. However, it was down by 3.53% for the week. The chart shows the drastic drop and highlights that gold ended the week between a thin resistance and support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 2% on Friday, 8 July 2022, as the market remained concerned about whether the jobs sector is strong and the possibility of the Fed raising rates aggressively. However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general. Furthermore, worries over a potential recession pulled prices down for the week and led to oil prices touching their 12-week low mid-week.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week.

The outlook for interest rate policies and inflation expectations shifts in the coming week will significantly impact the yellow metal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices suddenly reversed from the long-term uptrend after climbing up to almost $125 a barrel earlier this month. On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel. This occurred due to the interest rate hike by major central banks that would slow down the global economy and limit energy demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

With a loss of $300 billion in seven days, last week was one of the worst weeks in crypto history.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the chart above, the price of Bitcoin continued to slump, dropping by 34% in the past 7 days and trading below the $20k mark. However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022. This movement may indicate a swift turnaround after the recent successive declines since institutional traders may see a buying opportunity after Bitcoin reaches the rock-bottom level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, in particular, performed poorly, going down by 40% over the same period and trading at around $1,000.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part, macroeconomic factors were to blame for the downfall of the crypto market. Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests.

Moreover, the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy meeting was the main cause for the greenback&rsquo;s rally.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the above chart depicts, EUR/USD kept bouncing back and forth between the $1.0650 and $1.0750 levels for the first 4 days of the week before entering a nosedive on Friday, 10 June 2022. The pair ended the week at the $1.0519 level, which lies slightly under the SMA 10 at $1.0527 and coincides with the SMA 5 at $1.0519.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD pair declined for 4 consecutive days and closed the week at the $1.2316 level, which lies marginally above its SMA 5 at $1.2122. The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK. Furthermore, the receding resistance line has countered any upside movements by the cable pair since mid-April. The pair now awaits the Fed and Bank of England (BoE)&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions coming later this week for the next directional bias.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair has almost reached the &yen;135 level, hitting over two-decade highs. This price movement can be attributed to relentless dollar demand in the US due to inflation and stronger yields.

The pair&rsquo;s price increase was largely driven by government bond yields and inflation-related concerns.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the chart above, EUR/USD is priced between the 61.8% and 50% retracement levels near $1.0730 and $1.0713, respectively. On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

On the downside, its support level is at the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,846.47.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI ended the week above $118, marking a gain of over 3%.

Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment.

However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022.

As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests.

The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK.

The yellow metal's price went up significantly after a higher-than-expected inflation result. As seen within the chart, gold dipped below the $1,835 mark post the CPI data's release but bounced back to post a 1.64% change for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bond yields and gold are in an inverse relationship once again. With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs. This scenario resulted from US consumer prices growing faster than expected.

Altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) fell by around 6-10% for the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market leader Bitcoin fared better than other coins, falling by only 3% in the past 7 days. At the time of writing, BTC is currently under the $30,000 mark.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum, on the other hand, did not fare so well. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation fell by around 11% last week and was trading below $1,500.

However, the data suggested that inflation remains elevated and has not yet peaked in the US.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech stocks were under pressure as traders were concerned about higher rates and a potential recession.

On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

On the downside, its support level is at the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,846.47.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI ended the week above $118, marking a gain of over 3%.

This fall was a result of financial markets being gripped by panic as recession fears persisted and inflationary pressures rose, further intensified by Russia's energy crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second consecutive week, the British pound declined against the US dollar, bringing prices to their lowest since March 2020. Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend. The chart above shows that the pair was priced just above the 5 and 10 SMA's, ending its week at around $1.2035.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the USD/JPY pair continued to rise, it did not break through its 24-year high of &yen;137.00. The US June payrolls eased recession fears, causing the USD/JPY to rise. Furthermore, the inaction of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) towards its ultra-loose monetary policy and Shinzo Abe's assassination have hindered the yen's value and weakened the Japanese economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will be important for currencies since the US and the UK will release June inflation figures and UK GDP data.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment. However, it was down by 3.53% for the week. The chart shows the drastic drop and highlights that gold ended the week between a thin resistance and support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 2% on Friday, 8 July 2022, as the market remained concerned about whether the jobs sector is strong and the possibility of the Fed raising rates aggressively. However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general. Furthermore, worries over a potential recession pulled prices down for the week and led to oil prices touching their 12-week low mid-week.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Some indices are made of top-ranked companies in the market, while others may consist of handpicked companies from a particular stock market category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By compiling stock information of companies, stock indices allow you to get insights into the overall trend of price movements, market sentiment and general financial health of a market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s take a glimpse at how they work.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are stock market indices calculated?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stock index price indicates the average price of stocks in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various considerations when selecting which stocks will be included in a particular stock index. This could include the size of the company, its market capitalisation, or even its industry.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the companies are selected, the next step is to determine how much weight each of them will have in the index, as the weight of each stock may influence the index value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most popular ways indices are weighted:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this index type, stocks with a larger market capitalisation carry more weight. A company's market capitalisation can be calculated by multiplying its current stock price by the number of outstanding stocks. For instance, if a company has 1 million stocks selling at USD30, this company&rsquo;s stocks would have a market capitalisation of USD30 million. This company would have much more weight compared to a company with a market cap of USD1 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, the price of the index will change drastically as the price of the stock with a higher market cap changes. On the other hand, if a company with a low market cap experiences any change, it would have minimal effect on the stock index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most common index weighting, and most major stock indices use it to calculate their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An equal-weighted index is where stocks are weighed against each other equally, regardless of their price, market capitalisation, or any other factor. This means that every company&rsquo;s performance affects the index equally. Thus, to find the index's price made of 100 stocks, you&rsquo;d need to add up all their prices and divide the sum by 100. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weight of each company in a price-weighted index is determined by its current stock price. Regardless of their size, companies with more expensive stocks would have a heavier weight in the index than those with a lower price. For instance, if the stock index consists of four stocks worth USD10, USD20, USD30 and USD40, the stocks would make up 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total index, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s important to note that each index can have multiple variations. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index, tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US, is usually market-capitalisation-weighted, but there is also an equal-weighted version of it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do stock market indices help traders? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock indices mainly function as economic indicators or market barometers that measure financial health. The average value of stocks in a specific country&rsquo;s stock market shows how well its economy is doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By observing these indices, you get a sense of how the overall market is doing without monitoring individual stocks, and you can evaluate the performance of the market by comparing the current price of an index to its previous price. This allows traders to analyse market trends and understand market sentiment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, traders can also opt to trade on these indices. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular stock market indices on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade on popular stock indices with <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/cfd-trading-vs-options-trading-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a> by predicting the indices&rsquo; market movement and without buying the underlying stocks.

We go through the top benefits of trading in the commodities market and find out how it offers great trading opportunities.","blog_post":"<p>With a wide variety of assets across different levels of volatility, liquidity, and risk, the history-filled <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-are-commodities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodities market</a> offers traders plenty of great trading opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we'll go through why it's a good idea to trade commodities like gold and oil.</p>\n<h2>1. They balance your portfolio</h2>\n<p>Commodities offer a great way to diversify your trading portfolio because they tend to have a low correlation to traditional financial assets such as stocks or currencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Correlation measures how the values of two assets change in relation to each other. When there is a low correlation between two assets, it means that the value of the assets will move in opposite directions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, when the value of stocks drops, the value of commodities will rise. So if you&rsquo;re trading on both stocks and commodities, this helps you to balance your risk across a variety of markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. They protect you against inflation</h2>\n<p>You might have heard the term &ldquo;hedge against inflation&rdquo; when referring to commodities. Think of it like a physical hedge, which acts as a barrier protecting a piece of land. So, when commodities are the &lsquo;hedge&rsquo;, they protect you (the land) from the negative effects of inflation (outside influences).</p>\n<p>Inflation is what happens when purchasing power weakens because of rising prices. One of the main causes of rising prices is an increased demand in goods and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When there&rsquo;s a rising demand for goods, more raw materials (like metals or agricultural products) are needed to produce these goods, which leads to an increase in demand and the value of these materials. This is good news if you trade on them.</p>\n<h2>3. They are a store of value</h2>\n<p>Commodities also provide additional protection for your capital by acting as a store of value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A store of value refers to an asset that usually retains its value over time, without being significantly affected by economic or natural disasters. Precious metals are considered a store of value, or safe haven investments, as they have generally retained their value over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/why-trade-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gold</a> and silver for example, which have been traded for thousands of years and are still considered valuable commodities today. The value of gold increases even in failing economies thanks to increasing demand as people rush to store their wealth in a safe asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. They offer opportunities in a volatile market</h2>\n<p>The commodities market is highly volatile, with huge price fluctuations that can sometimes happen unexpectedly. Some might consider high volatility as a disadvantage when trading &mdash; for example, when prices drop rapidly and you&rsquo;re left with an asset that isn&rsquo;t valuable anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, on Deriv, you can trade <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs (contracts for differences)</a> and options on commodities, which allows you to trade on price movements without owning the physical asset. All you have to do is speculate on an asset&rsquo;s price movements &mdash; whether it&rsquo;ll go up or down &mdash; and earn a payout if the market moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This opens up plenty of exciting opportunities in the commodities market to potentially gain from significant price fluctuations. Plus, you&rsquo;ll be able to benefit from both rising and falling prices, as long as the price moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that a balanced portfolio or a highly volatile market doesn&rsquo;t guarantee profits or protection against losses. Just like when you trade in any other market, trading commodities comes with its own risks and the market can be significantly affected by unpredictable events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/3-tips-to-boost-your-commodities-trading-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tips for trading in the commodities market</a> before you get started.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

Learn about the factors that drive stock prices and make informed decisions when trading.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable place, and not all of its price movements can be explained. However, if you were to analyse the stock market a little deeper, you can observe a few factors that play a part in determining price movements. Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

We explore your options from crypto exchanges to crypto wallets to help you make an educated decision.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security is one of the most important aspects of crypto trading. However, if you trade crypto on Deriv, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it at all because you don&rsquo;t buy the actual cryptocurrency. You open your trades with fiat money. Whether you trade with CFDs, options or multipliers, you only predict the price movements of an asset and get a chance to earn a payout if your prediction is correct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you choose to </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-with-crypto-top-3-myths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trade </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crypto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of fiat money, you will actually own a cryptocurrency, and that's when you need safe storage for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to&nbsp;fiat money, there are two options to keep large amounts of it safe: you either have it in cash or store it in a bank. Cryptocurrency can also be stored in 2 ways: using crypto exchanges and crypto wallets. Both are digital storage, of course, as cryptocurrencies don&rsquo;t have a physical form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, here's an interesting note &ndash; neither crypto exchanges nor crypto wallets actually store cryptocurrency. They only provide secure access to it while the coins are stored on a blockchain. Just like when you use a credit or debit card &ndash; it&rsquo;s not actual fiat money, just a piece of plastic, but it gives you access to the money you stored in a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what's the equivalent of a card when it comes to cryptocurrency and accessing your crypto assets? It's your public and private keys.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are private and public keys in the crypto world?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public and private keys are strings of numbers, letters and other characters (similar to a password) that allow you to perform actions with your cryptocurrencies. A public key is similar to your bank account number &ndash; you can share it with other people, who can then transfer cryptocurrency to you. A private key is like your credit card PIN &ndash; not to be shared with anyone, as it gives access to your crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference in private key management is exactly what differentiates crypto exchanges from crypto wallets.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a crypto exchange?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency exchange is a service that allows you to buy and sell digital coins securely. An example of crypto exchanges on Deriv is </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/cashier/on-ramp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat onramp services</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &ndash; Changelly, Xanpool, or Banxa. These service providers let you exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency. The purchased crypto is deposited right into your Deriv account and can be used for trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-known crypto exchanges, especially when they are officially affiliated with an established broker, are one of the safest options to buy, sell, and trade crypto. However, when it comes to storing large amounts, experts advise against keeping your digital coins at crypto exchanges and broker accounts for an extended period of time due to security concerns. Crypto hacks, although rarely successful, usually target exchanges as they are places where a high concentration of cryptocurrency data flows through. If that happens, you have limited control over the safety of your crypto assets and have to rely on the exchange&rsquo;s service providers entirely to keep them protected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason for the limited control over your own crypto assets lies in private key access. Most cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide it &ndash; the key belongs to an exchange exclusively. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of storage is called custodial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to have full control over your crypto assets, a good way of keeping them safe is to transfer any crypto you don&rsquo;t use for trading to a secure crypto wallet.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a crypto wallet?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency wallet is a software (programme) or hardware (device) that lets you store your digital coins safely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software wallets are also called hot wallets and store your private keys in a programme connected to the internet. Just like almost any software nowadays, it can be accessed via a desktop app, mobile app or web browser. One of the most important features to look for when selecting a software wallet is two-factor authentication (2FA), as it strengthens security and provides ease of use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of hot crypto wallets are non-custodial, which means they give access to the private keys and the responsibility of its safekeeping to the owner. This type of crypto storage is usually considered much safer than custodial crypto exchanges, as long as wallets&rsquo; owners take proper care of them and backup their keys. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that some hot wallets are custodial too, and do not provide access to a private key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, store crypto access offline and are usually no larger than a USB flash drive. This type of wallet is considered a safer option because the device is only connected to the internet when you need to use your crypto, making it much harder to hack. The important security measure, in this case, is just keeping the device safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until very recently, the third type &ndash; a paper wallet, used to be considered the most secure way to protect crypto assets. A paper wallet literally means keeping your private key written or printed on a piece of paper. However, since there is a high risk of misplacing or damaging it, this type of wallet is gradually losing its popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both cold and paper wallet types are completely non-custodial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing one type of crypto storage over another is purely a matter of personal preference. But do remember that it is crucial to do your research and ensure that the service provider is well-trusted and not fraudulent.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, while reviewing your options, why don't you create </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to practise your trading skills risk-free?

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively. Now, all eyes are on the UK inflation report and the Fed Chairman&rsquo;s testimony for fresh directional commands for the cable pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor announced that the monetary policy could be eased further if needed.

The outlook for interest rate policies and inflation expectations shifts in the coming week will significantly impact the yellow metal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices suddenly reversed from the long-term uptrend after climbing up to almost $125 a barrel earlier this month. On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel. This occurred due to the interest rate hike by major central banks that would slow down the global economy and limit energy demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022. This movement may indicate a swift turnaround after the recent successive declines since institutional traders may see a buying opportunity after Bitcoin reaches the rock-bottom level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, in particular, performed poorly, going down by 40% over the same period and trading at around $1,000.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part, macroeconomic factors were to blame for the downfall of the crypto market. Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests.

This fall was a result of financial markets being gripped by panic as recession fears persisted and inflationary pressures rose, further intensified by Russia's energy crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second consecutive week, the British pound declined against the US dollar, bringing prices to their lowest since March 2020. Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend. The chart above shows that the pair was priced just above the 5 and 10 SMA's, ending its week at around $1.2035.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the USD/JPY pair continued to rise, it did not break through its 24-year high of &yen;137.00.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment.

The chart shows the drastic drop and highlights that gold ended the week between a thin resistance and support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 2% on Friday, 8 July 2022, as the market remained concerned about whether the jobs sector is strong and the possibility of the Fed raising rates aggressively. However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general. Furthermore, worries over a potential recession pulled prices down for the week and led to oil prices touching their 12-week low mid-week.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Some indices are made of top-ranked companies in the market, while others may consist of handpicked companies from a particular stock market category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By compiling stock information of companies, stock indices allow you to get insights into the overall trend of price movements, market sentiment and general financial health of a market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s take a glimpse at how they work.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are stock market indices calculated?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stock index price indicates the average price of stocks in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various considerations when selecting which stocks will be included in a particular stock index. This could include the size of the company, its market capitalisation, or even its industry.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the companies are selected, the next step is to determine how much weight each of them will have in the index, as the weight of each stock may influence the index value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most popular ways indices are weighted:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this index type, stocks with a larger market capitalisation carry more weight. A company's market capitalisation can be calculated by multiplying its current stock price by the number of outstanding stocks. For instance, if a company has 1 million stocks selling at USD30, this company&rsquo;s stocks would have a market capitalisation of USD30 million. This company would have much more weight compared to a company with a market cap of USD1 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, the price of the index will change drastically as the price of the stock with a higher market cap changes. On the other hand, if a company with a low market cap experiences any change, it would have minimal effect on the stock index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most common index weighting, and most major stock indices use it to calculate their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An equal-weighted index is where stocks are weighed against each other equally, regardless of their price, market capitalisation, or any other factor. This means that every company&rsquo;s performance affects the index equally. Thus, to find the index's price made of 100 stocks, you&rsquo;d need to add up all their prices and divide the sum by 100. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weight of each company in a price-weighted index is determined by its current stock price. Regardless of their size, companies with more expensive stocks would have a heavier weight in the index than those with a lower price. For instance, if the stock index consists of four stocks worth USD10, USD20, USD30 and USD40, the stocks would make up 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total index, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s important to note that each index can have multiple variations. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index, tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US, is usually market-capitalisation-weighted, but there is also an equal-weighted version of it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do stock market indices help traders? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock indices mainly function as economic indicators or market barometers that measure financial health.

Although US dollar bulls rallied throughout the week, recession fears pushed it back.

We go through the top benefits of trading in the commodities market and find out how it offers great trading opportunities.","blog_post":"<p>With a wide variety of assets across different levels of volatility, liquidity, and risk, the history-filled <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-are-commodities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodities market</a> offers traders plenty of great trading opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we'll go through why it's a good idea to trade commodities like gold and oil.</p>\n<h2>1. They balance your portfolio</h2>\n<p>Commodities offer a great way to diversify your trading portfolio because they tend to have a low correlation to traditional financial assets such as stocks or currencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Correlation measures how the values of two assets change in relation to each other. When there is a low correlation between two assets, it means that the value of the assets will move in opposite directions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, when the value of stocks drops, the value of commodities will rise. So if you&rsquo;re trading on both stocks and commodities, this helps you to balance your risk across a variety of markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. They protect you against inflation</h2>\n<p>You might have heard the term &ldquo;hedge against inflation&rdquo; when referring to commodities. Think of it like a physical hedge, which acts as a barrier protecting a piece of land. So, when commodities are the &lsquo;hedge&rsquo;, they protect you (the land) from the negative effects of inflation (outside influences).</p>\n<p>Inflation is what happens when purchasing power weakens because of rising prices. One of the main causes of rising prices is an increased demand in goods and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When there&rsquo;s a rising demand for goods, more raw materials (like metals or agricultural products) are needed to produce these goods, which leads to an increase in demand and the value of these materials. This is good news if you trade on them.</p>\n<h2>3. They are a store of value</h2>\n<p>Commodities also provide additional protection for your capital by acting as a store of value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A store of value refers to an asset that usually retains its value over time, without being significantly affected by economic or natural disasters. Precious metals are considered a store of value, or safe haven investments, as they have generally retained their value over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/why-trade-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gold</a> and silver for example, which have been traded for thousands of years and are still considered valuable commodities today. The value of gold increases even in failing economies thanks to increasing demand as people rush to store their wealth in a safe asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. They offer opportunities in a volatile market</h2>\n<p>The commodities market is highly volatile, with huge price fluctuations that can sometimes happen unexpectedly. Some might consider high volatility as a disadvantage when trading &mdash; for example, when prices drop rapidly and you&rsquo;re left with an asset that isn&rsquo;t valuable anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, on Deriv, you can trade <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs (contracts for differences)</a> and options on commodities, which allows you to trade on price movements without owning the physical asset. All you have to do is speculate on an asset&rsquo;s price movements &mdash; whether it&rsquo;ll go up or down &mdash; and earn a payout if the market moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This opens up plenty of exciting opportunities in the commodities market to potentially gain from significant price fluctuations. Plus, you&rsquo;ll be able to benefit from both rising and falling prices, as long as the price moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that a balanced portfolio or a highly volatile market doesn&rsquo;t guarantee profits or protection against losses. Just like when you trade in any other market, trading commodities comes with its own risks and the market can be significantly affected by unpredictable events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/3-tips-to-boost-your-commodities-trading-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tips for trading in the commodities market</a> before you get started.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

Learn about the factors that drive stock prices and make informed decisions when trading.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable place, and not all of its price movements can be explained. However, if you were to analyse the stock market a little deeper, you can observe a few factors that play a part in determining price movements. Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

The outlook for interest rate policies and inflation expectations shifts in the coming week will significantly impact the yellow metal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices suddenly reversed from the long-term uptrend after climbing up to almost $125 a barrel earlier this month. On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel. This occurred due to the interest rate hike by major central banks that would slow down the global economy and limit energy demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022. This movement may indicate a swift turnaround after the recent successive declines since institutional traders may see a buying opportunity after Bitcoin reaches the rock-bottom level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, in particular, performed poorly, going down by 40% over the same period and trading at around $1,000.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part, macroeconomic factors were to blame for the downfall of the crypto market. Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests. This has indirectly led to a sell-off from crypto traders as this raises concerns about the future of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US stocks market</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 82.2078%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial Avg (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29,888.78</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-627.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.06%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,265.99</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-22.33</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.20%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,674.84</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-74.79</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.99%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change (%) are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All 3 major indices finished the week with sharp losses.

Can they sharpen your trading strategy? Read our blog to find out.","blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jim Alvarez was a forex trader who usually traded major currency pairs. In 2016, when talks of Brexit were making headlines, he decided to include cross-currency pairs in his trading strategy, which enabled him to diversify his portfolio and balance out his risk.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are cross-currency pairs?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs, also known as currency crosses, are currency pairs which don&rsquo;t include the US dollar. In forex,&nbsp; currencies are traded against each other and the most popular are Euro, US dollar, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Pound sterling, Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar. If you exclude the US dollar from the list and trade any of these currencies against each other, you would be trading cross-currency pairs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did cross-currency pairs come to exist?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After World War II, globalisation was setting in, and there was a need to understand how the currencies of different countries ranked against each other. However, this called for a standardised format by which these currencies could be measured. Post-WWII, the US economy and currency ranked among the strongest internationally, and since the US dollar at this time was also linked to gold, it became the world's reserve currency. This means it is usually held by a central bank and is used as a common denomination for international trades and included in the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that happened, if a trader wanted to trade Pound sterling against Euro, they would have to convert Pound sterling to US dollar first and then US dollar to Euro. This created drawbacks and traders were losing out on favourable exchange rates as it took more time to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pace of globalisation increased and the forex market grew, traders wanted to have easy access to several currencies without relying on the US dollar. This is why cross-currency pairs were introduced &ndash; to ensure a seamless conversion of currencies that aren't linked to the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why you should consider adding cross-currency pairs to your trading portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs present multiple trading opportunities, and here are 4 reasons why they can be a beneficial addition to your trading strategy:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trade without being tied to the US dollar</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade currency pairs linked to the US dollar, you are limited to a single prediction of whether the US dollar might go up or down. However, with cross-currency pairs, you can consider other factors that are not affected by the US dollar and discover more trading opportunities. Trading cross-currency pairs can also be a part of your go-to trading strategy if you need to wait out volatile trading conditions with the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Diversify your portfolio&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading different instruments helps you to keep your portfolio varied and may increase your chances of enhanced potential profit. Plus, you also have the chance to trade currency pairs, which are sensitive to price movements in the commodities market because those countries produce and export various goods and services. Keep in mind this strategy depends on thorough research of political, social, and economic factors that influence these trends.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hedging&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hedging is a strategy in which you secure your trade (if the market doesn&rsquo;t move in your favour) by also placing an opposite trade. You can spread out the risk by trading different cross-currency pairs in order to secure yourself against the volatility of cross-currency rates.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase your trade volume during specific world events</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, if you wanted to capitalise on a world event that wasn't tied to the US dollar, you would have to place 2 separate trades, incurring 2 transaction fees. As an example, if you wanted to trade Euro and Pound sterling you would have to pay transaction fees for a EUR/USD trade and a GBP/USD trade. However, with cross-currency pairs, you get to place a trade directly on the currency itself &ndash; EUR/GBP. So your capital can be used to increase your trade volume instead of being used for transaction fees for several trades.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar is the currency of the world&rsquo;s leading economy, and its status comes with higher liquidity. That's why many traders prefer trading major currency pairs that include this currency. However, cross-currency trading can present some unique trading opportunities that you may want to explore. Depending on which cross-currency pair you want to trade, you can trade CFDs on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X or go for options and multipliers trading on DTrader.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few cross-currency pairs you can trade on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" alt=\"Cross-currency pairs on Deriv\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why don&rsquo;t you test cross-currency pair trading first before including it in your trading strategy and portfolio?

This fall was a result of financial markets being gripped by panic as recession fears persisted and inflationary pressures rose, further intensified by Russia's energy crisis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second consecutive week, the British pound declined against the US dollar, bringing prices to their lowest since March 2020. Boris Johnson was at the centre of a political storm that contributed to the pair's weakness, which was also influenced by recession fears and Brexit concerns. The resignation of Mr Johnson on Thursday, 7 July 2022, removed some political uncertainty, allowing prices to recover before the weekend. The chart above shows that the pair was priced just above the 5 and 10 SMA's, ending its week at around $1.2035.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the USD/JPY pair continued to rise, it did not break through its 24-year high of &yen;137.00. The US June payrolls eased recession fears, causing the USD/JPY to rise. Furthermore, the inaction of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) towards its ultra-loose monetary policy and Shinzo Abe's assassination have hindered the yen's value and weakened the Japanese economy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week will be important for currencies since the US and the UK will release June inflation figures and UK GDP data.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0e695a14-6b89-47c0-a97a-19000c901e07?width=2466&amp;height=1128\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Fears of a global recession seemed to have affected traders' confidence, causing gold prices to fall. Moreover, the Federal Reserve's constant talk of raising interest rates to curb soaring inflation was a significant deterrent. In fact, Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that the US central bank remains committed to bringing inflation under control and that the US economy is prepared to withstand tighter policy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Friday, 8 July 2022, gold went up by 0.40% due to a weaker US dollar and a mixed sentiment. However, it was down by 3.53% for the week. The chart shows the drastic drop and highlights that gold ended the week between a thin resistance and support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices rose by 2% on Friday, 8 July 2022, as the market remained concerned about whether the jobs sector is strong and the possibility of the Fed raising rates aggressively. However, oil posted a weekly decline of roughly 3.4% in what was a volatile week for commodities in general. Furthermore, worries over a potential recession pulled prices down for the week and led to oil prices touching their 12-week low mid-week.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/e26236d0-8471-4714-98eb-e7e13e438f4a?width=2462&amp;height=1126\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Some indices are made of top-ranked companies in the market, while others may consist of handpicked companies from a particular stock market category.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By compiling stock information of companies, stock indices allow you to get insights into the overall trend of price movements, market sentiment and general financial health of a market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s take a glimpse at how they work.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How are stock market indices calculated?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stock index price indicates the average price of stocks in it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various considerations when selecting which stocks will be included in a particular stock index. This could include the size of the company, its market capitalisation, or even its industry.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the companies are selected, the next step is to determine how much weight each of them will have in the index, as the weight of each stock may influence the index value.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most popular ways indices are weighted:</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market-capitalisation-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this index type, stocks with a larger market capitalisation carry more weight. A company's market capitalisation can be calculated by multiplying its current stock price by the number of outstanding stocks. For instance, if a company has 1 million stocks selling at USD30, this company&rsquo;s stocks would have a market capitalisation of USD30 million. This company would have much more weight compared to a company with a market cap of USD1 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, the price of the index will change drastically as the price of the stock with a higher market cap changes. On the other hand, if a company with a low market cap experiences any change, it would have minimal effect on the stock index.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the most common index weighting, and most major stock indices use it to calculate their value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equal-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An equal-weighted index is where stocks are weighed against each other equally, regardless of their price, market capitalisation, or any other factor. This means that every company&rsquo;s performance affects the index equally. Thus, to find the index's price made of 100 stocks, you&rsquo;d need to add up all their prices and divide the sum by 100. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Price-weighted indices</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The weight of each company in a price-weighted index is determined by its current stock price. Regardless of their size, companies with more expensive stocks would have a heavier weight in the index than those with a lower price. For instance, if the stock index consists of four stocks worth USD10, USD20, USD30 and USD40, the stocks would make up 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of the total index, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s important to note that each index can have multiple variations. For example, the S&amp;P 500 index, tracking the performance of 500 large companies in the US, is usually market-capitalisation-weighted, but there is also an equal-weighted version of it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do stock market indices help traders? </span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stock indices mainly function as economic indicators or market barometers that measure financial health. The average value of stocks in a specific country&rsquo;s stock market shows how well its economy is doing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By observing these indices, you get a sense of how the overall market is doing without monitoring individual stocks, and you can evaluate the performance of the market by comparing the current price of an index to its previous price. This allows traders to analyse market trends and understand market sentiment.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, traders can also opt to trade on these indices. </span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular stock market indices on Deriv</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Deriv, you can trade on popular stock indices with <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> and <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/cfd-trading-vs-options-trading-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a> by predicting the indices&rsquo; market movement and without buying the underlying stocks.

Although US dollar bulls rallied throughout the week, recession fears pushed it back. Based on the chart above, the pair ended the week at around $1.0414, establishing a bearish tone with lower lows and lower highs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders were concerned that aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank would tip the global economy into recession.

We go through the top benefits of trading in the commodities market and find out how it offers great trading opportunities.","blog_post":"<p>With a wide variety of assets across different levels of volatility, liquidity, and risk, the history-filled <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-are-commodities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commodities market</a> offers traders plenty of great trading opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this blog post, we'll go through why it's a good idea to trade commodities like gold and oil.</p>\n<h2>1. They balance your portfolio</h2>\n<p>Commodities offer a great way to diversify your trading portfolio because they tend to have a low correlation to traditional financial assets such as stocks or currencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Correlation measures how the values of two assets change in relation to each other. When there is a low correlation between two assets, it means that the value of the assets will move in opposite directions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example, when the value of stocks drops, the value of commodities will rise. So if you&rsquo;re trading on both stocks and commodities, this helps you to balance your risk across a variety of markets.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>2. They protect you against inflation</h2>\n<p>You might have heard the term &ldquo;hedge against inflation&rdquo; when referring to commodities. Think of it like a physical hedge, which acts as a barrier protecting a piece of land. So, when commodities are the &lsquo;hedge&rsquo;, they protect you (the land) from the negative effects of inflation (outside influences).</p>\n<p>Inflation is what happens when purchasing power weakens because of rising prices. One of the main causes of rising prices is an increased demand in goods and services.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When there&rsquo;s a rising demand for goods, more raw materials (like metals or agricultural products) are needed to produce these goods, which leads to an increase in demand and the value of these materials. This is good news if you trade on them.</p>\n<h2>3. They are a store of value</h2>\n<p>Commodities also provide additional protection for your capital by acting as a store of value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A store of value refers to an asset that usually retains its value over time, without being significantly affected by economic or natural disasters. Precious metals are considered a store of value, or safe haven investments, as they have generally retained their value over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/why-trade-gold/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gold</a> and silver for example, which have been traded for thousands of years and are still considered valuable commodities today. The value of gold increases even in failing economies thanks to increasing demand as people rush to store their wealth in a safe asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>4. They offer opportunities in a volatile market</h2>\n<p>The commodities market is highly volatile, with huge price fluctuations that can sometimes happen unexpectedly. Some might consider high volatility as a disadvantage when trading &mdash; for example, when prices drop rapidly and you&rsquo;re left with an asset that isn&rsquo;t valuable anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, on Deriv, you can trade <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/videos/?t=what-is-cfd-trading%3F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs (contracts for differences)</a> and options on commodities, which allows you to trade on price movements without owning the physical asset. All you have to do is speculate on an asset&rsquo;s price movements &mdash; whether it&rsquo;ll go up or down &mdash; and earn a payout if the market moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This opens up plenty of exciting opportunities in the commodities market to potentially gain from significant price fluctuations. Plus, you&rsquo;ll be able to benefit from both rising and falling prices, as long as the price moves according to your prediction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that a balanced portfolio or a highly volatile market doesn&rsquo;t guarantee profits or protection against losses. Just like when you trade in any other market, trading commodities comes with its own risks and the market can be significantly affected by unpredictable events.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/3-tips-to-boost-your-commodities-trading-skills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tips for trading in the commodities market</a> before you get started.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

Learn about the factors that drive stock prices and make informed decisions when trading.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable place, and not all of its price movements can be explained. However, if you were to analyse the stock market a little deeper, you can observe a few factors that play a part in determining price movements. Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively. Now, all eyes are on the UK inflation report and the Fed Chairman&rsquo;s testimony for fresh directional commands for the cable pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor announced that the monetary policy could be eased further if needed.

The outlook for interest rate policies and inflation expectations shifts in the coming week will significantly impact the yellow metal.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices suddenly reversed from the long-term uptrend after climbing up to almost $125 a barrel earlier this month. On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel. This occurred due to the interest rate hike by major central banks that would slow down the global economy and limit energy demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d17a34f9-7234-4c7e-bc79-f6dfd780321a?width=1671&amp;height=821\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022. This movement may indicate a swift turnaround after the recent successive declines since institutional traders may see a buying opportunity after Bitcoin reaches the rock-bottom level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, in particular, performed poorly, going down by 40% over the same period and trading at around $1,000.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part, macroeconomic factors were to blame for the downfall of the crypto market. Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests. This has indirectly led to a sell-off from crypto traders as this raises concerns about the future of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US stocks market</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 82.2078%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial Avg (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">29,888.78</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-627.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.06%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,265.99</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-22.33</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-0.20%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 49.2089%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 16.1392%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,674.84</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 14.8734%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-74.79</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; width: 19.9367%; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-1.99%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change (%) are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All 3 major indices finished the week with sharp losses.

Can they sharpen your trading strategy? Read our blog to find out.","blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jim Alvarez was a forex trader who usually traded major currency pairs. In 2016, when talks of Brexit were making headlines, he decided to include cross-currency pairs in his trading strategy, which enabled him to diversify his portfolio and balance out his risk.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are cross-currency pairs?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs, also known as currency crosses, are currency pairs which don&rsquo;t include the US dollar. In forex,&nbsp; currencies are traded against each other and the most popular are Euro, US dollar, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Pound sterling, Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar. If you exclude the US dollar from the list and trade any of these currencies against each other, you would be trading cross-currency pairs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did cross-currency pairs come to exist?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After World War II, globalisation was setting in, and there was a need to understand how the currencies of different countries ranked against each other. However, this called for a standardised format by which these currencies could be measured. Post-WWII, the US economy and currency ranked among the strongest internationally, and since the US dollar at this time was also linked to gold, it became the world's reserve currency. This means it is usually held by a central bank and is used as a common denomination for international trades and included in the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that happened, if a trader wanted to trade Pound sterling against Euro, they would have to convert Pound sterling to US dollar first and then US dollar to Euro. This created drawbacks and traders were losing out on favourable exchange rates as it took more time to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pace of globalisation increased and the forex market grew, traders wanted to have easy access to several currencies without relying on the US dollar. This is why cross-currency pairs were introduced &ndash; to ensure a seamless conversion of currencies that aren't linked to the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why you should consider adding cross-currency pairs to your trading portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs present multiple trading opportunities, and here are 4 reasons why they can be a beneficial addition to your trading strategy:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trade without being tied to the US dollar</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade currency pairs linked to the US dollar, you are limited to a single prediction of whether the US dollar might go up or down. However, with cross-currency pairs, you can consider other factors that are not affected by the US dollar and discover more trading opportunities. Trading cross-currency pairs can also be a part of your go-to trading strategy if you need to wait out volatile trading conditions with the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Diversify your portfolio&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading different instruments helps you to keep your portfolio varied and may increase your chances of enhanced potential profit. Plus, you also have the chance to trade currency pairs, which are sensitive to price movements in the commodities market because those countries produce and export various goods and services. Keep in mind this strategy depends on thorough research of political, social, and economic factors that influence these trends.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hedging&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hedging is a strategy in which you secure your trade (if the market doesn&rsquo;t move in your favour) by also placing an opposite trade. You can spread out the risk by trading different cross-currency pairs in order to secure yourself against the volatility of cross-currency rates.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase your trade volume during specific world events</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, if you wanted to capitalise on a world event that wasn't tied to the US dollar, you would have to place 2 separate trades, incurring 2 transaction fees. As an example, if you wanted to trade Euro and Pound sterling you would have to pay transaction fees for a EUR/USD trade and a GBP/USD trade. However, with cross-currency pairs, you get to place a trade directly on the currency itself &ndash; EUR/GBP. So your capital can be used to increase your trade volume instead of being used for transaction fees for several trades.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar is the currency of the world&rsquo;s leading economy, and its status comes with higher liquidity. That's why many traders prefer trading major currency pairs that include this currency. However, cross-currency trading can present some unique trading opportunities that you may want to explore. Depending on which cross-currency pair you want to trade, you can trade CFDs on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X or go for options and multipliers trading on DTrader.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few cross-currency pairs you can trade on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" alt=\"Cross-currency pairs on Deriv\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why don&rsquo;t you test cross-currency pair trading first before including it in your trading strategy and portfolio?

Learn about the factors that drive stock prices and make informed decisions when trading.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable place, and not all of its price movements can be explained. However, if you were to analyse the stock market a little deeper, you can observe a few factors that play a part in determining price movements. Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

In this panel, you can have 4 separate charts of different assets at once, or expand one of them into the full version. You can also customise each chart by right-clicking on it and selecting the &lsquo;Properties&rsquo; tab &ndash; choose how each chart looks, what it shows, and even its colour schemes.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading panel</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trading panel is located at the bottom of the platform. It is a useful feature to keep track of information on your trades. For example, you can see all the open and running trades in the &lsquo;Trade&rsquo; tab, access all the closed trades in the &lsquo;History&rsquo; tab, and check all the notifications in the &lsquo;Journal&rsquo; tab.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the trading panel has &lsquo;News&rsquo; and &lsquo;Calendar&rsquo; tabs that can help you with the fundamental analysis to fine-tune your trading strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the main features of the DMT5 platform used by traders on a regular basis, but the platform has many more functions that can enhance your trading journey.

Once the price breaks through one of the lines, it tends to follow the direction of the previous trend.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4e951d3a-d97a-47e4-b9b3-498af63cbdf8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4e951d3a-d97a-47e4-b9b3-498af63cbdf8\" alt=\"Flag Chart Patterns on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></span></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pennant</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pennant chart pattern is very similar to the flag. It also has a well-defined &lsquo;pole&rsquo;, but its support and resistance trend lines meet in the middle horizontally. The price usually breaks out, following the direction of the previous trend.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f8f20a82-2aed-45e5-a089-f37fb785b8b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f8f20a82-2aed-45e5-a089-f37fb785b8b3\" alt=\"Pennant Chart Patterns on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></span></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wedge</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wedge chart pattern is very similar to the pennant, but its support and resistance trend lines can be rising or falling instead of meeting strictly in the middle of the pattern and forming a horizontal shape. In either case, the price is highly likely to move in the same direction as a previous trend.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5cfaef35-ae54-4aa8-98d8-5fe1be3e49a6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/5cfaef35-ae54-4aa8-98d8-5fe1be3e49a6\" alt=\"Wedge Chart Patterns on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></span></a></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bilateral chart patterns</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bilateral chart patterns give 50/50 chances of the trend reversing or continuing, which gives traders an excellent opportunity to place 2 trades simultaneously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All 3 types of bilateral patterns resemble the previously described continuation patterns, with 3 significant differences:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ascending triangle has a strictly horizontal resistance trend line</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Descending triangle has a strictly horizontal support line</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Symmetrical triangle doesn&rsquo;t have a distinct &lsquo;pole&rsquo;, unlike the flag pattern.

Professional traders use a wide range of patterns, but the trading strategy is the same, whichever pattern you find in your price chart. As soon as the price breaks out of the resistance or support line, you place your buy or sell trade, based on the predicted direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it's important to keep in mind that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while these patterns can help indicate a market&rsquo;s future price movement, they are still only predictions and don't give you 100% accuracy.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There is always a chance of a false breakout when the price breaks through the line and then returns shortly after without forming a new trend.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, you should carefully assess your risk and practise on a risk-free </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before trading with real money. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you want to take your technical analysis skills one step further, in our next blog post,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;we will walk you through the automatically calculated tools to help you refine your trading strategy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"c1925a11-e999-4750-97af-cc243186ce40","main_image":{"id":"1db8a6d6-9c36-4aaa-9350-c39e37d72a87","description":"Top 3 tips on trading for beginners.

Technology has improved market accessibility tremendously, making trading for beginners and for anyone much easier, as long as there&rsquo;s access to the internet using laptops or mobile devices. But just because it is so readily accessible now doesn't mean that you should take online trading lightly, especially if you're a beginner.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to be prepared and aware of the trading basics before diving into it straight away. We've outlined the top 3 tips to help you get started on your journey to becoming a smart trader.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Do your research</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good research is key to online trading, and, as a beginner, your research should focus on two important things &mdash; finding a trustworthy broker and understanding the markets you want to trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Selecting a reputable broker is crucial. Make time to read <a href=\"https://www.trustpilot.com/review/deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviews</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about the broker you're eyeing, how they manage thriving markets, and the variety of platforms they offer. Go for a broker that offers user-friendly platforms that are suitable for both beginners and experienced traders. Check out its list of trading assets, so you have options to choose from and can diversify your trading portfolio. Most importantly, verify that the broker is properly licensed and regulated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you decide which broker to trade with, selecting your assets to trade is your next step. The process of choosing the asset to trade doesn't differ much from finding the right broker. It entails time and research as well. Having a solid understanding of each market's assets will help you make deliberate and smart trading decisions. It would help to consider market trends and world events, too, as these factors significantly affect price movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can trade on assets in various markets &mdash; from trading <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cfd-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFDs</a> on forex, </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-are-stocks-how-and-where-to-trade-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities to <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptocurrency</a>. Diversifying your portfolio is a smart way to trade because it can protect you from losing all your money in case a market moves against your prediction.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think researching markets could be a bit much for you, you can start trading synthetic indices on Deriv. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv.com/markets/synthetic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Synthetic indices</a> simulate real-world market movement. Its movements are based on a cryptographically secure random number generator audited by an independent third party to ensure they cannot be tampered with or manipulated.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unaffected by natural events and free of market and liquidity risks, synthetic indices offer you the flexibility to trade different synthetic markets with high or low-risk characteristics. These indices are available to trade on Deriv 24/7, even on weekends and public holidays. Go ahead and sign up for a <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv demo account</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;and try trading synthetic indices.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Use a free demo account to test out your trading strategies</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best traders hone their skills through practise and experience, part of which involves handling losses. Most licensed and regulated brokers offer their clients a demo account pre-loaded with virtual funds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Demo accounts provide the same trading experience as real accounts, which helps new traders familiarise themselves with the trading platforms.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0f7a68fb-456a-41f8-b59b-f29bae4487ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/0f7a68fb-456a-41f8-b59b-f29bae4487ca\" alt=\"Deriv&rsquo;s sign up page\" width=\"1684\" height=\"1232\" /></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The demo account for each of the platforms on Deriv will allow you to practise trading before deciding to trade with real money. To <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">set up a demo account,</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;you simply need to register with Deriv, create your login credentials, and select the demo account option. Your demo account will be credited with 10,000 USD virtual money so that you can open trades, practise trading, and sharpen your strategies.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We recommend you practise your trading strategies on one or more platforms to find one that works best for you and improve your strategies before jumping on a real account.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Enjoy the process and practise patience</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting started can be a real challenge, but it&rsquo;s best to take your time and enjoy the process.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to online trading, patience is critical. Practising patience with your trades may help you discover what strategy works best for you. Never open a trade just for the sake of trading. It would be best to trade only when you&rsquo;re confident with your strategy, considering the external variables that may affect the market you&rsquo;re about to trade.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It's also important to note that to keep a disciplined approach to online trading you should develop a strategy and stick with it. Trades don't usually result in massive payouts. Losses are likely to occur, so stay realistic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many successful traders share the same characteristics. As a beginner, you could marvel at their success but, most importantly, analyse what made them successful.

Learn about the factors that drive stock prices and make informed decisions when trading.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stock market is a volatile and unpredictable place, and not all of its price movements can be explained. However, if you were to analyse the stock market a little deeper, you can observe a few factors that play a part in determining price movements. Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

You can customise your toolbar by right-clicking on any of the icons and selecting the &lsquo;Customise&rsquo; tab.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workspace is divided into panels that have different capabilities. Let&rsquo;s see what each of them does.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market watch</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The market watch panel is located on the top left side of the platform and gives you access to all assets available for trading, along with their live quotes. If you right-click an individual asset and select the &lsquo;Specification&rsquo; tab, you'll be able to see more information about it, such as margin rate, contract size, and trading timings.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigator (not available in the web terminal)</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The navigator panel is located in the middle of the platform&rsquo;s left side and provides access to your accounts and additional resources, like technical indicators, expert advisors, and more.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chart panel</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chart panel is the biggest one in the workspace and takes the middle part of the platform. In this panel, you can have 4 separate charts of different assets at once, or expand one of them into the full version. You can also customise each chart by right-clicking on it and selecting the &lsquo;Properties&rsquo; tab &ndash; choose how each chart looks, what it shows, and even its colour schemes.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading panel</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trading panel is located at the bottom of the platform. It is a useful feature to keep track of information on your trades. For example, you can see all the open and running trades in the &lsquo;Trade&rsquo; tab, access all the closed trades in the &lsquo;History&rsquo; tab, and check all the notifications in the &lsquo;Journal&rsquo; tab.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the trading panel has &lsquo;News&rsquo; and &lsquo;Calendar&rsquo; tabs that can help you with the fundamental analysis to fine-tune your trading strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the main features of the DMT5 platform used by traders on a regular basis, but the platform has many more functions that can enhance your trading journey.

This discovery has soon turned into a trading discipline, commonly used by traders nowadays.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of chart patterns you can use in your technical analysis, but they all follow the same logic: the support trend line is at the bottom, and the resistance trend line is at the top.

Once the price breaks through one of the lines, it tends to follow the direction of the previous trend.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4e951d3a-d97a-47e4-b9b3-498af63cbdf8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4e951d3a-d97a-47e4-b9b3-498af63cbdf8\" alt=\"Flag Chart Patterns on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></span></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pennant</span></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The pennant chart pattern is very similar to the flag.

Understanding these factors can help you take more calculated risks when you trade in the stock market.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Supply and demand</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main factors that influence stock prices is supply and demand. When the supply and demand do not balance each other out, the price of stocks fluctuates. The general rule is that when demand is higher than supply, the prices rise, and if supply is higher than demand, the prices drop.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, when there is more demand for Apple stock but not enough stock to meet this demand, the price goes up, and if there are many Apple stocks available on the market but not a lot of demand for them, the prices fall.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market sentiment</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The prices of stocks also depend on the human factor, particularly human psychology. People are guided by their emotions, which can also be true when trading.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traders can be influenced by rumours swirling around the stock market. If there are talks about a certain company making lesser profit than expected, traders, afraid to lose their earnings, may steer clear of the company, or could sell off their stocks. Similarly, if there is news about the company expecting massive profits, the surge of confidence could influence traders to buy more stocks in hopes that the stock prices would continue going up in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another example of how market sentiment affects stock prices is when there are major geopolitical issues happening. Traders often keep up with current affairs, and when there is a situation, such as a boycott of a certain company and its products, they could anticipate a dip in profits. Thus, shareholders in the company may be inclined to sell some or all of their holdings, which could, in turn, cause the stock price to decline.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentals of the company&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to supply and demand, and market sentiment, a company's fundamentals are also essential in determining its stock prices. A company&rsquo;s performance shapes what traders think would happen in the future, and their expectations and analysis of the changes that happen to the company affect stock prices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if there is an internal shift in a certain company, like a change in the board of directors, traders could look into the previous performance of the new board of directors, and analyse whether the new management can bring more success to the company. If they expect the company to suffer losses under the new management, they may avoid trading stocks of that company. They might even sell their stocks at a slightly lower price to avoid big losses in the future. If the majority of traders feel the same way, following the supply and demand principle, the price of the company&rsquo;s stocks could fall because of surplus supply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a change happens in a company, such as rebranding, traders might think it would profit the company in the foreseeable future. Because of that, they could buy more stocks of this company with the expectation that the price will continue to rise, increasing their earnings.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some traders may have a more accurate prediction of the stock market by relying on research analysts and making their observations based on stock market reports.

You can customise your toolbar by right-clicking on any of the icons and selecting the &lsquo;Customise&rsquo; tab.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The workspace is divided into panels that have different capabilities. Let&rsquo;s see what each of them does.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market watch</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The market watch panel is located on the top left side of the platform and gives you access to all assets available for trading, along with their live quotes.

In this panel, you can have 4 separate charts of different assets at once, or expand one of them into the full version. You can also customise each chart by right-clicking on it and selecting the &lsquo;Properties&rsquo; tab &ndash; choose how each chart looks, what it shows, and even its colour schemes.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading panel</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trading panel is located at the bottom of the platform. It is a useful feature to keep track of information on your trades. For example, you can see all the open and running trades in the &lsquo;Trade&rsquo; tab, access all the closed trades in the &lsquo;History&rsquo; tab, and check all the notifications in the &lsquo;Journal&rsquo; tab.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the trading panel has &lsquo;News&rsquo; and &lsquo;Calendar&rsquo; tabs that can help you with the fundamental analysis to fine-tune your trading strategy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the main features of the DMT5 platform used by traders on a regular basis, but the platform has many more functions that can enhance your trading journey.

Professional traders use a wide range of patterns, but the trading strategy is the same, whichever pattern you find in your price chart. As soon as the price breaks out of the resistance or support line, you place your buy or sell trade, based on the predicted direction.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it's important to keep in mind that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while these patterns can help indicate a market&rsquo;s future price movement, they are still only predictions and don't give you 100% accuracy.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There is always a chance of a false breakout when the price breaks through the line and then returns shortly after without forming a new trend.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consequently, you should carefully assess your risk and practise on a risk-free </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before trading with real money. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you want to take your technical analysis skills one step further, in our next blog post,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;we will walk you through the automatically calculated tools to help you refine your trading strategy.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}]}},"pageContext":{"locale":"en","localeResources":{"335040248":"About us","Greeting":"Hello!"},"pathname":"/academy/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1403902406","188943173","2998272888","3480019573","4141256230","764694655"]}
