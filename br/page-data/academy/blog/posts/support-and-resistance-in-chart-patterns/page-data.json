All you need to do is intuitively identify a shape or pattern in your price chart and outline it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to studies, our eyes tend to look for patterns everywhere, so finding one in a price chart is quite easy. But it is important to understand the concept of support and resistance trend lines first, as they define almost all the chart patterns.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are trend lines?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A trend line in a price chart is a line that connects a few price points of your selection, e.g. the opening prices within the past week or month. Whenever the price crosses this line, it&rsquo;s called a breakout, and that&rsquo;s when a new trend is usually formed. The breakout serves as a signal to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d22729fd-ad29-4866-99d5-6c4130cc7dae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/d22729fd-ad29-4866-99d5-6c4130cc7dae\" alt=\"Price Breakout in A Candlestick Chart on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support and resistance are arguably the most widely used trend lines in trading.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are support and resistance trend lines?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support and resistance trend lines represent levels that act as barriers where the price tends to stop moving forward. Support is the bottom price level where the downtrend meets support and stops falling. And resistance is the top level where the uptrend meets resistance and stops rising.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/34f6de2a-7e68-43e9-8197-cd474e4a8453\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/34f6de2a-7e68-43e9-8197-cd474e4a8453\" alt=\"Support and Resistance Trend Lines on Deriv\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like almost everything else in trading, support and resistance are influenced by supply and demand. Here is how it works.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let&rsquo;s say the price of gold has been gradually decreasing over the past few days. As you probably know, the price goes down when traders sell an asset in large quantities, and supply starts exceeding demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there is a group of people who want to buy gold when it&rsquo;s as cheap as 50 USD per gram, for example. Once they start buying it at 50 USD, the demand will increase, exceeding supply, and the price will start going up again.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So the price dropped to 50 USD, bounced off, and started going up again. The 50 USD price level is the support in this case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resistance is essentially the same process but reversed. Let&rsquo;s say some people missed the opportunity to buy gold at 50 USD, and they are willing to pay more, but only as much as 100 USD. As soon as the price reaches 100 USD, they will stop buying it, the demand drops, and the price stops increasing. The100 USD price level will act as resistance in this case.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, the price quite often forms a trend, bouncing between the same support and resistance price levels. But eventually, after reaching one of these levels, the price doesn&rsquo;t bounce back and keeps moving in the same direction (falling below 50 USD or rising above 100 USD in our example), that&rsquo;s when a breakout occurs. That&rsquo;s exactly why you need trend lines and chart patterns &ndash; to catch the moment it happens.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are drawing tools?&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you visualise and define trend lines in your price chart, trading platforms are usually equipped with drawing tools. For example, here are the drawing tools on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/62870d56-c422-40b6-9f91-cd02da032e03\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/62870d56-c422-40b6-9f91-cd02da032e03\" alt=\"Drawing Tools in Deriv&rsquo;s D Trader Trading Platform\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use any of them to draw right over your price chart and delete the drawings whenever you want. If you're a beginner, the 'Line' tool is the easiest to use, since it's the most straightforward way to draw trend lines.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, here are the support and resistance trend lines made with the help of &lsquo;Line&rsquo; drawing tool.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/14b4466b-c703-42b2-83c3-f9db7276c3de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/14b4466b-c703-42b2-83c3-f9db7276c3de\" alt=\"Support and Resistance Trend Lines in Deriv&rsquo;s D Trader Price Chart\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading on support and resistance trend lines can be a strategy on its own. But creating chart patterns with the help of these two trend lines and some additional ones tends to give more accurate predictions, increasing your chances of success.</span></p>\n<p><span
