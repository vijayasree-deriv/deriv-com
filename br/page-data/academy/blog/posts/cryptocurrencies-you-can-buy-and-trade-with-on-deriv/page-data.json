However, which cryptocurrency should you choose? There are thousands of digital coins on the market, and each one has its own features.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Deriv, we've narrowed down the list of cryptocurrencies available to fund your cryptocurrency account to five major and popular cryptocurrencies. Let's take a closer look at their unique characteristics.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Bitcoin (BTC)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin is the most well-known and accepted cryptocurrency in the world. The unique features of this digital coin have turned it from being just another coin to exchange into a store of value with high purchasing power &mdash; an equivalent of gold in the crypto world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like the famous precious metal, Bitcoin has a limited supply (21 million coins only), and it is also decentralised. The limited supply provides protection from inflation, while the decentralisation protects from the control and influence of governments.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The BTC transaction specifications are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: approximately 30 minutes&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 3 (3x10 minutes each = about 30 minutes)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: high</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Ethereum (ETH)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethereum was created as an open-source blockchain platform to create, release, and monetise apps, where Ether token served as a payment method. Due to its popularity, it eventually became accepted as a payment currency by merchants and service providers outside the platform.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation. However, experts believe that the value of this digital coin is still underestimated and should be much higher.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifications for Ethereum transactions are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: from 1 to 15 minutes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 6 (6x10 seconds = 1 minute)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high, depending on network congestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Litecoin (LTC)</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Litecoin is widely considered to be the silver to Bitcoin&rsquo;s gold. It was indeed created to complement Bitcoin as a more accessible and more affordable cryptocurrency. As a result, Litecoin has quickly become a new medium of exchange &mdash; used for payments, while Bitcoin transformed into a store of value &mdash; an asset that will have purchasing power in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Litecoin has a much larger but still limited supply of 84 million coins and significantly lower transaction fees, which made it the most inexpensive option for cryptocurrency transfers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifications of LTC transactions are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: approximately 30 minutes&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 12 (12x2.5 min each = about 30 minutes)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: very low</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stablecoins: USDT (OMNI &amp; ERC-20) and USDC</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is tied to an asset like USD or gold to stabilise its price. Generally speaking, stablecoin is a digital representation of fiat money.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Tether (USDT) OMNI&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tether is by far the largest stablecoin by market cap. Each unit of Tether is backed by the USD with a 1:1 equivalent. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies, Tether is issued and regulated by Tether Limited, which makes it a fully centralised cryptocurrency.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The &lsquo;omni&rsquo; part of this digital coin means that Deriv accepts USDT transactions that are proceeded via omnilayer &ndash; a software built on top of Bitcoin&rsquo;s blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &lsquo;erc-20&rsquo; part means that the USDT transactions are also processed via the new transport layer based on the Ethereum blockchain.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It gives Tether the security of Bitcoin or Ethereum while letting it operate as an independent cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USDT OMNI transaction specifications are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: from 1 to 15 minutes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 6 (6x10 seconds = 1 minute)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high (depending on network congestion)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specifications for ERC-20 (eUSDT) transactions are as follows:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: from 1 to 15 minutes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 6 (6x10 seconds = 1 minute)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high, depending on network congestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. USD Coin (USDC)&nbsp;</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USD Coin is the second-largest stablecoin that is also tied to the USD with a 1:1 ratio but powered by Ethereum&rsquo;s blockchain. This coin is also centralised and held by a group of three companies that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency. USDC is currently the most transparent stablecoin in the crypto world, and it is accepted by hundreds of companies worldwide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The USDC transaction specifications are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction processing time: approximately 30 minutes&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amount of confirmations: 3 (3x10 min each = about 30 minutes)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transaction fees: vary &ndash; from very low to very high, depending on network congestion</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know the main differences between these cryptocurrencies, all you have to do is choose your preferred one to fund your Deriv crypto account.
